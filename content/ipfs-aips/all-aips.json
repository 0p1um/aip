    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLlama proposes listing CVX, the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol, on Aave v2 mainnet as collateral with borrowing enabled. The risk parameters detailed within have been provided by Gauntlet.\n\n## Abstract\n\nConvex Finance allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV. Convex Finance intends to add support for other tokens like FXS in the future.\n\nListing CVX on Aave v2 will enable lenders to receive yield and borrowers of CVX to partake in Convex Finance’s tokenomics model to earn yield. As CVX has a different, but similar tokenomics model to CRV, Llama expects there to be similar demand for CVX. aCRV is one of the highest earning assets on Aave v2 and Llama hopes CVX will become a significant source of revenue for the community.\n\nThe Aave community also benefits from being able to use the aCVX revenue to participate in Convex Finance’s tokenomics and vote CRV rewards to Curve pools that contain aTokens.\n\n## Motivation\n\nListing CVX on the Aave V2 market would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage as CVX is not currently listed on any major lending market. This asset listing has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earning asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around [$744k](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal initialises the CVX reserve, enables variable borrowing, sets a reserve factor and configures the reserve as collateral. As needed, it also connects a price source on the AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe recommend the following risk parameters.\nRisk Parameters:\nLTV \t\t\t\t\t45%\nLiquidation Threshold\t60%\nLiquidation Bonus\t\t8.5%\nReserve Factor\t\t\t20%\n\nVariable Interest Rate Parameters:\nUOptimal 50%\nR_0      0%\nR_s1     7%\nR_s2     200%\n\naToken = [0x0e9134467A273De42BE82D8764BF1E9cC0e0c8Ba](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0e9134467A273De42BE82D8764BF1E9cC0e0c8Ba)\nStable Debt Token = [0x10638C31Daeee246f0026f7174E1f30fB17010F5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10638c31daeee246f0026f7174e1f30fb17010f5)\nVariable Debt Token = [0xa2eC40E5e60d71144e16C92A4C78F8b38FEA7877](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2eC40E5e60d71144e16C92A4C78F8b38FEA7877)\nInterest Strategy = [0x1dA981865AE7a0C838eFBF4C7DFecb5c7268E73A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1da981865ae7a0c838efbf4c7dfecb5c7268e73a)\nChainlink CVX/ETH Price Feed = [0xC9CbF687f43176B302F03f5e58470b77D07c61c6](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC9CbF687f43176B302F03f5e58470b77D07c61c6)\nCVX Token = [0x4e3FBD56CD56c3e72c1403e103b45Db9da5B9D2B](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4e3FBD56CD56c3e72c1403e103b45Db9da5B9D2B)\n\nThe governance forum proposal discussing Add CVX on Aave V2 mainnet market can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-cvx-convex-finance-token/7319) and the snapshot vote can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x399300d33120f63cdda37068b46e5da8485dbeeb1100dab0367a223124798f5b).

A full security report can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-ecosystem-reserve-v2/tree/release/final-proposal#security), but as summary:\n- Full test coverage via units tests in the Forge environment.\n- Security review from Aave community members.\n- Minimal changes from the Sablier's v1 logic used as base for the streaming capabilities. The original codebase is audited and battle tested (running in production with meaningful funds for a long time).\n- Set of properties (formal verification) by Certora.\n- Slither analysis of the codebase.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [AaveEcosystemReserveController](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d569673daa0575c936c7c67c4e6aeda69cc630c#code)\n- [AaveEcosystemReserveV2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1aa435ed226014407fa6b889e9d06c02b1a12af3#code)\n- [PayloadAaveBGD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1e12071bd95341aa92fcba1513c714f9f49282a4#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

By partially funding the AGD with stablecoins, budgeting will be easier. The aUSDC will be funded through an approval and the AAVE will be funded with a transfer. Our initial proposal was made in May 2021 and our renewal proposal was made in November 2021.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within Aave through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the ecosystem. We aim to drive development on top of Aave and ensure a constant influx of talented builders to maintain Aave’s long term growth. We help build culture and community around the Aave ecosystem that in turn attracts the best contributors.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/renew-aave-grants\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal includes a $3M transfer of AAVE from the AaveEcosystemReserve to the grants DAO multisig and the AaveV2Collector approving $3M of aUSDC to the grants DAO multisig. This will allow the grants DAO to withdraw funds as needed and let the V2Collector to continue to earn interest in the meantime. The proposa payload will target the contract AaveEcosystemReserveController and call the function `function transfer(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)` and `approve(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n**Target Contracts**\n\nProposalPayload = [0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal for significantly and continuously improving the security of the Aave platform and the dApps built on top of it, by offering our formal verification and path coverage tooling service to the Aave Platform contributors and the Aave Protocol dApp developers. The initial proposal is for 6 months starting from the execution of this proposal.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCertora proposes two approaches to significantly increase the confidence in the platform itself and in the smart contracts built on top of it, even when the code is evolving.\n\nFirst, we propose to change the project-based relationship of Aave and Certora, to an ongoing relationship, where we will provide ongoing support and rule-writing for Certora Prover on Aave’s code. This service will be provided to all community contributions to core and periphery parts of the Aave ecosystem. This will ensure that the constantly-evolving code of Aave’s platform remains secure, protecting its users’ assets.\n\nSecond, we will develop a new symbolic execution tool (path coverage) which will significantly increase the coverage of code areas where we look for bugs, complementing the more focused nature of the Certora Prover. This tool’s results will be visible to all via a unique dashboard we will build. In addition, it will be open-source, so the community could contribute to its development.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of the major risks in managing a complex system of smart contracts such as Aave's is that it is harder to ensure that changes introduced via governance are safe, and that they do not break the behavior of the protocol.\n\nThese risks were highlighted by a recent incident in which a bug was introduced in a Compound governance proposal, leading to huge nonrecoverable financial losses. Of course, such bugs are not exclusive to Compound— they have been affecting many DeFi protocols.\n\nDetecting vulnerabilities before they are deployed is difficult because of the lack of good security tools for smart contract development. Smart contract developers often rely on manual auditing to prevent bugs, but audits are difficult to employ in the setting of ongoing, time-controlled governance proposals. Moreover, even the best auditor can miss critical bugs due to the complexity of the code.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSee `discussions` for further information.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis AIP implements the proposal for its 6 months period. According to the forum discussion, the price is $1,700,000, where:\n1. $1,000,000 is paid in USDC. These funds will be transferred from the Aave Collector, and will be vested using [Sablier](https://docs.sablier.finance/).\n2. $700,000 is paid in Aave, also vested using Sablier.\n3. A one-time payment of $200,000 in Aave tokens will be transferred to a special 3/4 multi-sig wallet owned by the Aave Governance, 2 members from the Aave community, and 2 Certora delegates. The wallet will serve as a special fund for paying decentralized community rule writers.\n\nThe AAVE price is computed using the [Chainlink AAVE/USD price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x547a514d5e3769680Ce22B2361c10Ea13619e8a9) upon execution of the proposal.\n\nThe transactions that will be performed are as follows:\n1. Transfer a total worth of $900,000 in AAVE tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93.\n2. Approve $700,000 worth of AAVE tokens to Sablier.\n3. Create a Sablier stream with Certora as the beneficiary, to stream the $700,000 worth of Aave over 6 months.\n4. Transfer $200,000 worth of AAVE to a multisig co-controlled by Aave and Certora teams.\n5. Transfer USDC 1,000,000 from the Aave Collector to the ShortExecutor, first transfering aUSDC and then withdrawing them from the pool.\n6. Approve USDC 1,000,000 to Sablier.\n7. Create a Sablier stream with Certora as the beneficiary, to stream the USDC 1,000,000 over 6 months.\n\nThe source code for the proposal payload contract is available [here](https://github.com/Certora/aave-proposal-test).\nThe contract is deployed at [0x879A89D30b04b481Bcd54f474533d3D6A27cFd7D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x879a89d30b04b481bcd54f474533d3d6a27cfd7d).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP would list BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK, and SUSHI from the AAVE V2 market on the Aave Polygon Market, and list GHST as a new asset to the Polygon market as collateral. WMATIC risk parameters are also being updated.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBAL, CRV, DPI, LINK, and SUSHI have been voted in by governance to be added to the Polygon market. These tokens are already listed in the V2 market.\n  \nWMATIC parameters are being updated to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGHST is the token that powers the Aavegotchi universe. Aavegotchi (Playable DeFi-backed NFTs) utilizes Aave aTokens in game as collateral assets for Aavegotchis “playable bank”. Given Aave’s recent launch onto Polygon (where Aavegotchi is deployed) the Aavegotchi community believes it would be a great idea to have GHST token as collateral on Matic Aave. If GHST gets listed as an collateral on Aave, users of Aavegotchi will be able to use aGHST as collateral within their Aavegotchis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the availability of cross chain governance, it's time to make long overdue updates to the Polygon market.\n\n## Specifications\n  \nThe risk parameters for the assets coming from the V2 market to the Polygon market are as follows:\n\n#### BAL\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### CRV\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### DPI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n- Not borrowable\n#### LINK\n- LTV: 50%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 65\n- Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 10%\n#### SUSHI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 35%\n- Not borrowable\n\n## Adding GHST to the Polygon Market\n\n1. Aavegotchis are crypto-collectibles (NFT). Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Matic blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level 2, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral 2, and equipped wearables. GHST token is the backbone of Aavegotchi Realm. GHST is an in-game asset, used in all operations in-game (excluding usage of GHST as a collateral for summoning your Aavegotchi, which are aTokens powered by Aave) such as buying portals (opened\\closed), wearable items, potions and etc.\n\n2. Users of Aavegotchi will borrow GHST, to use it as an in-game asset, to speculate on in-game values or for other in-game purposes. Users of Aavegotchi will use it as a collateral to summon their gotchis with it because aTokens are another backbone of the game. To summon your Aavegotchi you need to have a specific amount of aTokens to make it possible.\n\n3. GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve 5). The token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 1.2 DAI. The all-time high is around 1.9 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price.\n\nA significant challenge for Aavegotchi as a project was deciding to migrate our ecosystem from Ethereum to Polygon (then known as Matic). Expensive gas fees would have made it impossible for our players to use Aavegotchi NFTs (which require constant onchain attention). However, from January to March, we were able to complete the migration and launch successfully onto Polygon.\n\n4. GHST is the official utility token of the Aavegotchi ecosystem and can be used to purchase portals, wearables, and consumables.\n\n5. The inflation of GHST tokens through purchases on the bonding curve is positively correlated to the GHST price. The bonding curve has been mathematically programmed to increase the price of GHST as the circulating supply of GHST increases.\n\n6. The bonding curve has minting and burning permissions, but these permissions are governed by the AavegotchiDAO which exists on Ethereum Mainnet. GHST tokens are not arbitrarily minted or burned. The supply is determined by inputs via the bonding curve.\n\n#### Market Data\n\n- Market Cap - \\$140,000,000\n- 24hr Trading volume - \\$29,209,070\n- Currently listed on 14 exchanges: Binance, Okex, Poloniex, Uniswap, Gate.io, LBank, Bilaxy, Hoo, MXC, BiBox, 0x, BamBoo Relay, QuickSwap, 1ich Exchange;\n- Maturity - 15 months.\n\n#### Proposed Risk Parameters\n- LTV: 25%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%  \n  \n#### Socials\n\n- Telegram group: - Telegram: Contact @aavegotchi 8 - 12,000+ members;\n- Discord - https://discord.gg/aavegotchi 16,000+ members\n- https://twitter.com/aavegotchi - twitter 67,000 followers;\n- Active forum https://dao.aavegotchi.com/\n- Governance Snapshot https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth\n- Active code development - https://github.com/aavegotchi\n\n#### Token Stats\n\n- Contract’s date of deployments: 14 September 2020 (Ethereum)\n- Number of transactions:\n  - Ethereum: 143,397\n  - Polygon: 2,507,992\n- Number of holders for tokens:\n  - Ethereum: 6,427\n  - Polygon: 68,943\n- Currently circulating Supply - 66,419,514\n- Current total supply - 66,419,514\n\n#### Full Disclosure\n\nStani Kulechov is an official advisor of Aavegotchi, and Aave has invested into Pixelcraft Studios, the development team behind Aavegotchi.\n  \n## WMATIC Risk Parameter Update\n  \nThe criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the MATIC token on Polygon network is presented below:\n\n|Holders:|168,102|B+ to A-|B+|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Transactions|100,240,631|A||\n|Mkt Cap|586,568,252|B+ to A-||\n|Av.

However, the volatility score of B- (C+ to B-) is justified by the 0.06579 score compared to 0.064 in the table presented in the documentation 1. Further to this, assets like BAL and BAT on Ethereum have similar vol characteristics to wMATIC on Polygon. The Norm. Vol parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.\n  \n#### wMATIC Volatility Data (Polygon Network Data)\n\n|Time|S.D Vol|\n| --- | --- |\n|t=7 days|0.08475|\n|t=30 days|0.06535|\n|t= 90 days|0.06622|\n|t= 180 days|0.09013|\n|t= 365 days|NA|\n\nBased upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Recommended Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|wMATIC Liquidation Threshold|65%|70%|\n|wMATIC Loan to Value|50%|65%| \n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal is the first cross chain proposal for AAVE. AAVE holders will vote through the Ethereum mainnet to change parameters on the Polygon market. The proposal makes use of the [cross chain bridge](https://github.com/aave/governance-crosschain-bridges) to send a message to the [Polygon bridge executor](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdc9A35B16DB4e126cFeDC41322b3a36454B1F772). The following functions are called on the [lending pool configurator](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x26db2b833021583566323e3b8985999981b9f1f3) from the executor:\n\nFor GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK:\n* batchInitReserve((address aTokenImpl, address stableDebtImpl, address variableDebtImpl, uint8 decimals, address interestRateStrategy, address underlyingAsset, address treasury, address incentivesController, string underlyingAssetName, string aTokenName, string aTokenSymbol, string varTokenName, string varTokenSymbol, string stableDebtName, string stableDebtSymbol, bytes params)[])\n* setReserveFactor(address asset, uint256 reserveFactor)\n\nFor GHST, BAL, CRV, LINK:\n* enableBorrowingOnReserve(address asset, bool stableBorrowEnabled)\n\nFor GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK, WMATIC:\n* configureReserveAsCollateral(address asset, uint256 ltv, uint256 liquidationThreshold, uint256 liquidationBonus)\n\nAnd the following function is called on the [Aave Oracle](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0229f777b0fab107f9591a41d5f02e4e98db6f2d#code) for GHST, BAL, DPI, CRV, SUSHI, LINK:\n* setAssetSources(address[] assets, address[] sources)\n\nA payload contract has been created to initiate all the above changes.\n\n[Payload Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8b97a0B37974Ddec0CB8B8039a4e593457DefE8c)\n\nTests and implementation are located [here](https://github.com/pakim249CAL/Polygon-Asset-Deployment-Generic-Executor).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd a `claimRewardsToSelf()` function to the liquidity mining incentives contract, so a caller can claim their own rewards without specifying the `to` recipient.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAave incentive contracts currently only contain claiming functions in which the caller specifies the recipient `to` address, who will receive the claimed rewards. Unfortunately, this poses a security problem for abstractly-designed smart contract claimants that do not have fully-trusted originators of claiming txs. This is the case for Enzyme vaults. By adding an additional claiming function to the incentive contract that uses `msg.sender` instead of `to`, the tx originator no longer needs to be trusted.\n\nThis simple addition - that reuses the exact same claiming logic as the current claiming functions with no changes to storage layout - will increase composability opportunities with Enzyme and similarly architected protocols.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEnzyme is a decentralised asset management infrastructure built on Ethereum. It allows asset managers to build on-chain investment Vaults that utilise and allocate to the newest innovations in DeFi. Because all transactions occur on the Ethereum blockchain, compliance, accounting, and investor management services are rendered programatically and at a dramatically-reduced cost to their traditional finance counterparts.\n\nAmongst other things, Enzyme Vaults can interact with AAVE by lending. We are currently also working on accommodating the borrowing functionality to enable leveraged strategies.\n\nIn order to keep providing our users with superior asset management tools in DeFi, we want to open up the liquidity mining option for them as soon as possible. Our users rely on having the latest DeFi functionality in Enzyme to reach their full potential.\n\nBenefits for AAVE:\n\n- Increased AAVE adoption by the Enzyme user base and other similarly architected protocols\n- Tapping into a new and fast-growing community\n- A closer collaboration between our two projects & communities\n- Enzyme contracts have been audited by PWC, Chain Security and some of the leading auditors in the space who sit on the Enzyme Council\n- Opening up the possibility for new and novel use-cases to be built around AAVE\n\n## Specification\n\nAdds `function claimRewardsToSelf(address[] calldata assets, uint256 amount)` to the liquidity mining incentives contract, which reuses the logic of `claimRewards()` but uses `msg.sender` instead of `to`.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is the simplest, least intrusive way to support claimants who might not be trusted to send claimed rewards to a third party.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest suites (local, mainnet fork, and proposal flow on mainnet fork) have been included at https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/pull/4 and have been reviewed by Aave team.\n\n## Implementation\n\nFull PR: https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/pull/4\n\nNew incentives implementation contract on Ethereum mainnet: `0xD9ED413bCF58c266F95fE6BA63B13cf79299CE31`\n\nUpgrade to be executed via deployment of `ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol`: https://github.com/aave/incentives-controller/blob/e5e8b2c994ee29b0af883db7c94add372b4423b2/contracts/proposals/ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol\n\nDeployed proposal payload (`ProposalIncentivesV2Executor.sol`) on Ethereum mainnet: `0xb8fA635fEC4E6BDb05e7937cBeF01214991e9D5a`\n\n## Audit\n\nhttps://github.com/aave/incentives-proposal/blob/1ef7705546dc7970795003e435f76b73efebbb1d/audits/Enzyme_Aave_IncentivesController_Improvement.pdf\n\n## Snapshot vote\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmcgTovk982fcUTN17qtDyZ4oCoVGnKZJGuwMVtqspfphk\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon.\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nV3 Efficiency mode: stablecoins\nV3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $2M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n## Specifications\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $90M, and has around 70M MAI outstanding.\n\n**Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Metis, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Gnosis.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nMAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\nSeveral other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\nThe Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nLending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\nListed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\nTop two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\nMAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\nMAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\nMAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.**\n\n**Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n## Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n- Market Cap: ~$70M\n- 24h Volume: >$40M\n- Volatility: Low\n- Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n- Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n- Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Project: https://www.mai.finance/\n- Defillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/qidao\n- Whitepaper: https://docs.mai.finance/\n- Document portal: https://docs.mai.finance/\n- Source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed asset: https://github.com/0xlaozi\n- Twitter: 17k followers: https://twitter.com/QiDaoProtocol\n- Telegram: 2,130 members: @QiDaoProtocol\n- Discord: 8,987 members: https://discord.com/qidaoprotocol\n- Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nMAI token\n\n- Date of deployment: May 4, 2021\n- Number of transactions: +3M\n- Number of crosschain token holders: 16k+\n\n## Security Considerations\nMAI has undergone 2 thorough audits (linked below).

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSecuritize asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Securitize as a “whitelister” on the Aave Arc market.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSecuritize is the leading digital asset securities company. As a FINRA member Broker-Dealer and the first SEC-registered Transfer Agent operating with digital asset securities, Securitize is one of the most regulated firms in the entire digital assets industry.\n\nSecuritize has an excellent track record for providing comprehensive compliance services to a vast array of digital assets companies. Our proprietary investor passport, Securitize iD, is globally recognized and built upon Securitize’s battle-tested KYC/KYB/AML/CFT compliance program, allowing Securitize iD to be trusted by over 450K registered investors and over 200 issuers to date.\n\nWe have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-appoint-securitize-as-a-whitelister-to-aave-arc/6434) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community. We believe that Securitize satisfies all criteria necessary to be appointed as a whitelister for Aave Arc.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe institutional appetite for DeFi is growing, but that hunger remains mostly unsatisfied due to compliance obstacles. In response, pragmatic DeFi communities like Aave launched permissioned versions of their services, like Aave Arc, and are wisely seeking regulated third parties, like Securitize, to facilitate user credential and access management.\n\nAs a whitelister, Securitize will function as one of the trusted gatekeepers for Aave Arc, ensuring that only wallets with verified credentials can access the permissioned liquidity pool. Therefore, institutions can safely leverage the transactional benefits of Aave — e.g., supply, borrow, and liquidate digital assets — while still abiding by their compliance requirements. Securitize believes that this is a monumental first step toward the eventual mass inclusion of institutions in the decentralized economy.\n\n## Specification\n\n“Whitelisting” is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc. The term refers specifically to the process of:\n\nConducting KYC/KYB checks on the user;\nOnboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions;\nGranting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.\nIn addition, Aave Arc whitelisters perform a similar role on Arc as guardians do on Aave V2. Specifically, whitelisters can use a multi-sig veto on governance proposals that add excessive compliance risk on the Aave Arc protocol. For example, existing whitelisters can veto the addition of a privacy coin if such a coin is impermissible in the relevant jurisdiction, or veto the addition of a whitelister that has a poor reputation for compliance.\n\nThe whitelisting is managed via a [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract, in which whitelisters are designated as Permission Admins. Permission Admins are permitted to add or remove wallets grants to the Aave Arc market by calling addPermissions() and removePermissions() contract methods, respectively.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave Governance community voted on the Snapshot proposal with “YES” 389K AAVE (99.98%) and “No” 87 AAVE (0.02%)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation is described [here](https://github.com/aave/arc-timelock#adding-a-new-permissionadmin)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe proposal executes a single call to the PermissionManager contract to add [Securitize](https://etherscan.io/address/0x36b8A1D23BDc76092aD88A1c4Ef59fafD4931b03) as PermissionAdmin in Aave ARC market:\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0x36b8A1D23BDc76092aD88A1c4Ef59fafD4931b03]);`\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

To date, and despite the large TVL potentially attracting a lot of malicious actors, Aave users haven’t suffered any losses due to smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities. Lately, it has been increasingly difficult to contract reputable smart contract security auditors, as most of the prominent firms in this space are booked out for months.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal authorises payment of the minimum engagement fee outlined in [the proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/sigma-prime-security-assessment-services-for-aave/8518) (US$ 1,296,000) through the following:\n- Upfront payment for 50% of the minimum engagement fee (US$ 648,000) paid in aUSDC and aUSDT (even split, $324,000 each)\n- Remaining 50% (US$ 648,000) paid at the end of the engagement period (12 months) via two (2) payment streams in aUSDC and aUSDT (even split, $324,000 each), with each stream starting 12 months from now, and lasting a duration of 1 second.\n\nIf the maximum fee was to apply to this engagement, a subsequent proposal will be pushed forward for the remaining amount in 12 months (i.e at the end of the engagement period).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nSigma Prime is an information security consultancy who specialise in Blockchain technology and administered from Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe primary focus of Sigma Prime is to help secure distributed systems through in-depth security assessments of decentralised projects, while concurrently researching and developing core Blockchain infrastructure. Over the past 6 years, we have been working with some of the most prominent organisations in the space: the Ethereum Foundation, Chainlink, SushiSwap, 1inch, the Filecoin Foundation, NEAR, Arbitrum, Lido, Rocket Pool, and plenty of others.\n\nSigma Prime is also the founder and maintainer of the Lighthouse project, an open-source implementation of the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Consensus specification, written in Rust. Lighthouse is one of the leading Ethereum consensus client implementations and has a particular focus on performance and security.\n\nThroughout the works performed for Aave, the feedback received from the leadership team has been highly positive.

There is no intention to enable borrowing of stETH on AAVE v2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nListing stETH on AAVE can work to attract a larger audience to both AAVE and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to AAVE as market participants look to borrow against stETH.\n\nstETH makes a perfect DeFi collateral and is beneficial for a number of reasons covered in the Specifications section of this AIP.\n\n## Specification\n1. **What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\n- Jacob (jbeezy) is a full time member of the DAO working to facilitate integrations for st-Assets across DeFi in protocols such as Aave among others.\n- Gregory (GrStepanov) is a full time protocol contributor working on technical integrations.\n\n2. **Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\n\n#### Lido Background\n\nThe Lido Protocol, built on Ethereum’s beacon chain to start, allows users to earn staking rewards on the beacon chain without rendering their assets illiquid or maintaining staking infrastructure.\n\nLido was [announced](https://blog.lido.fi/how-lido-works/) in November 2020. The testnet was released in late November.\n\nLido today has 3 products (stETH, stSOL, bLuna) managed by 4 teams in separate organizations. Across these products is a multi billion dollar TVL and has pushed Lido to #6 on [DeFi Llama rankings](https://defillama.com/protocol/lido). stETH has also been accepted as part of Nexus Mutual’s treasury as part of their [risk management strategy](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641).\n\nLido has begun the process to move over to a fully non-custodial solution. Details can be found here: [Withdrawal Credentials in Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/withdrawal-credentials-in-lido/).\n\nThe Lido DAO manages the liquid staking protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g. setting fees, assigning node operators and oracles) through the voting power of governance token holders.\n\nLido has been audited by Sigma Prime, Quantstamp and MixBytes.\n\n#### stETH Background\n\nLido allows users to deposit ETH and receive stETH. The deposited ETH is then pooled and staked with node operators selected by the Lido DAO. stETH represents the user’s staked ETH balance of the beacon chain along with staking rewards accrued or penalties inflicted on validators in the beacon chain. When withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain, stETH can be redeemed for unstaked ETH and accumulated rewards.\n\nUnlike beacon chain ETH, stETH can be freely transferred and traded. Onboarding stETH to Aave would allow users to borrow against stETH.\n\nThe balance of stETH is based on the total amount of staked ETH plus total staking rewards minus slashing applied on validators. stETH rebases daily.\nThe stETH supply stands at 1,697,460 - worth $5.4BN using current stETH prices.\n\n3. **Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nstETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons.\n\n- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;\n- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from \ncoin reserve factors).\n- stETH is a very liquid asset with $5+ billion in liquidity used across [multiple DeFi projects](https://dune.xyz/LidoAnalytical/Integration-monitor-dashboard\n). stETH<>ETH liquidity pool on Curve is the deepest LP in DeFi with $3.8 billion TVL.\n\n4. **Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nLido protocol background is listed in Question #2.\n\nThere is a DAO and it is live. The Lido DAO consists of, amongst others, Semantic VC, ParaFi Capital, Libertus Capital, Terra, Bitscale Capital, StakeFish, StakingFacilities, Chorus, P2P Capital and KR1, Stani Kulechov of Aave, Banteg of Yearn, Will Harborne of Deversifi, Julien Bouteloup of Stake Capital and Kain Warwick of Synthetix.\n\nThe Lido treasury has been diversified and DAO members now include Paradigm, Three Arrows Capital, DeFiance Capital, Jump Trading, Alameda Research, iFinex, Dragonfly Capital, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, The LAO and [angels](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506).\n\nThe Lido suite of products consist of st-assets which represent the underlying staked collateral on various protocols. Currently this is stETH, bLuna, stLuna and stSOL and is managed by 4 teams in separate organizations to further mitigate centralization risk.\n\nThere are further wrapped versions to address platform limitations around rebasing assets or bridging to other ecosystem. These wrapped assets are minted/burned based on locking of the st-asset. Currently there is wstETH (non-rebasing) and bETH (Terra representation of stETH).\n\nEarly challenges were overcome with DAO member support, speed of execution and utility of st-assets. The last one is particularly critical in the success of any liquid product.\n\n5. **How is the asset currently used?**\n\nstETH is used in a number of ways.\n\n- a productive asset (e.g. in Nexus Mutual Treasury risk management strategy);\n- compounding yield strategies in DeFI (AMMs, autofarms) (e.g. Convex, Yearn, Harvest);\n- multichain collateral (e.g. wstETH on Ethereum on Maker and bETH on Terra in Anchor).\n\n5. **Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, stETH is minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.\n\n6. **Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nstETH token is the upgradable contract behind `AppProxyUpgradeable` proxy at https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84. Lido DAO can change the implementation with the successful DAO vote.\n\nThe roles and addresses can be checked in the Aragon UI: https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/permissions/app/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84\n\nTo mitigate withdrawal risks, Lido staking went live on December 18th, 2020, through a [withdrawal key ceremony](https://blog.lido.fi/lido-withdrawal-key-ceremony/). Chorus One, Staking Facilities, Certus One, Argent, Banteg (yearn.finance), Alex Svanevik (Nansen), Anton Bukov (1inch), Michael Egorov (Curve/Nucypher), Rune Christensen (MakerDAO), Will Harborne (DeversiFi), and Mustafa Al-Bassam (LazyLedger) came together over a four-day event to generate threshold signatures for Lido’s withdrawal keys in a secure environment on air-gapped machines. \nLido has already migrated to a non-custodial solution and >60% of all stETH already uses this. Details can be found here: [Withdrawal Credentials in Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/withdrawal-credentials-in-lido/).\n\n8. **Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n**Market Cap** $5.5B\n\n**Volatility** - Over the past year, stETH proved to hold peg extremely well through various market conditions.

Thus, it has 2 private balances and 1 public balance.\n\n1. The internal (fixed-supply) balance and total supply are used for book-keeping. The deposited balance is stored in stETH shares and converted into the amount of the tokens with functions from stETH. Users’ balances are book-kept with the underlying ERC20 token.\n2. The internal (elastic-supply) balance and total supply correspond to the deposited balance without accrued interest. Rebasing of aSTETH according to stETH happens in this layer.  \n3. The external (elastic-supply) balance and total supply correspond to the deposited balance with interest.\n\nExternally, the aSTETH behaves similar to every other aToken. It always maintains a 1:1 peg with the underlying stETH. \n\nThe current implementation doesn't support borrowing, neither with variable nor with stable interest rates. The stableDebtSTETH and variableDebtSTETH contracts extend default stableDebtToken and variableDebtToken contracts accordingly to make it impossible to use borrowing with aSTETH because default debt tokens are not compatible with the AStETH contract.\n\n## Implementation\n\n#### Code\nAStETH https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd233D4ffdAA9B7d1d3E6b18CCcb8D091142893a  \nvariableDebtSTETH https://etherscan.io/address/0xde2c414b671d2db93617d1592f0490c13674de24  \nstableDebtSTETH https://etherscan.io/address/0x8180949ac41ef18e844ff8dafe604a195d86aea9  \nDefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy https://etherscan.io/address/0xff04ed5f7a6C3a0F1e5Ea20617F8C6f513D5A77c  \nSteps the proposal will execute: start a vote to add stETH as a new asset.\n\n#### Security Considerations\nStandard technical risks of smart contracts apply to the AToken implementation.\nThe implementation has been audited by MixBytes() and considered safe. Read the full report from [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/MixBytes%20AAVE%20stETH%20integration%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2002-22.pdf).\n\n**Proposed Risk Parameters**\nLTV: 70%  \nLiquidation Threshold: 75%  \nLiquidation Bonus: 7.5%  \nReserve Factor: 10%  \n\n**Interest Rate Model:**  \nUOptimal: 60%  \nBase: 0%  \nSlope 1: 8%  \nSlope 2: 200%  \n\nAs stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset, we propose listing stETH on AAVE v2 market with borrowing disabled. \n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n**Smart contract risks**\n\nLido faces smart contract risks. To mitigate these, Lido has been audited multiple times - by Quantstamp, Sigma Prime, and MixBytes (see [Audits](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits)), with no critical issues found.\n\n**Counterparty risks**\n\nLido is a DAO. Decisions in the Lido DAO are made through proposals and votes - community members manage protocol parameters, node operators, oracle members, and more. The Lido staking infrastructure for stETH consists of 22 node operators, with a focus on decentralization.\nLido relies on a set of oracles to report staking rewards to the smart contracts. Their maximum possible impact is limited by the [recent upgrade](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-2.md#sanity-checks-the-oracles-reports-by-configurable-values) (limit oracles report change by 10% APR increase in stake and 5% decrease in stake), and the operators of oracles are all well-known entities: Stakefish, Certus One, Chorus One, Staking Facilities, DSRV, Blockscape, Everstake, SkillZ, RockX, Allnodes, P2P Validator, and others.\nRead further in Lido [documentation](https://docs.lido.fi/token-guides/steth-superuser-functions/).\n\n**Market risk**\n\nOver the past year, stETH proved to hold the ETH peg 1:1 steadily.\nFour liquidity pools across different DEXes are incentivized with significant LDO rewards. Curve stETH<>ETH LP has grown into the deepest LP across DeFi, which makes it extremely resistant to any attempts of moving the peg.\n\n**Staking risks**\n\nstETH faces staking risks, specifically validator risks including slashing and hostage risks. To mitigate these, Lido works only with best-in-class validators with a track record of success.\nBesides, there's an ongoing [discussion in the community](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-6-in-protocol-coverage-proposal/1468) about in-protocol coverage options to mitigate slashing risks.\n\n**Price feed risk**\n\nThe ChainLink price feed for stETH is based on the pools with extremely deep liquidity. This makes stETH price very stable and resilient. Manipulating stETH price at this point would require staggering amount of resources and potentially render this kind of attack unreasonable.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFireblocks asks the Aave Governance community to approve the appointment, adoption, and authorization of Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, as a “whitelister” on the Aave Arc market.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAave Arc is a “permissioned” version of the software underlying V2 of the Aave protocol that employs an additional smart contract layer to only allow “whitelisted” or “permissioned” users to engage with the protocol.\n\nOnly regulated entities that (a) employ KYC/KYB principles in accordance with FATF guidelines to identify and accept their clients; (b) have robust AML/CFT compliance programs; and (c) are currently in good standing with an active license/registration in the entity’s operating jurisdiction will be accepted as “whitelisters” on Aave Arc.\n\nWe believe that Fireblocks LLC, a Fireblocks company, satisfies all the qualification requirements to be a whitelister. We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/add-fireblocks-as-a-whitelister-on-aave-arc/5753) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who have been searching to engage with DeFi in a way that comports with their own internal requirements.\n\nApproval of Fireblocks LLC can potentially also facilitate the integration of other “whitelisters” and institutions into instances of the Aave protocol. This may have multiple benefits, including the creation of sustainable governance practices for Aave Arc whitelisters and whitelister customers, as well as the enablement of benefits to the ecosystem, such as the onboarding of regulated fiat on/off ramps and protocol deployments connected to debit cards, high yield savings accounts and other innovative fintech products.\n\n## Specification\n\n“Whitelisting” is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc. The term refers specifically to the process of:\n1. Conducting KYC/KYB checks on the user;\n2. Onboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions;\n3. Granting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.\n\nIn addition, Aave Arc whitelisters perform a similar role on Arc as guardians do on Aave V2. Specifically, whitelisters can use a multi-sig veto on governance proposals that add excessive compliance risk on the Aave Arc protocol. For example, existing whitelisters can veto the addition of a privacy coin if such a coin is impermissible in the relevant jurisdiction, or veto the addition of a whitelister that has a poor reputation for compliance.\n\nThe whitelisting is managed via a [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract, in which whitelisters are designated as Permission Admins.  Permission Admins are permitted to add or remove wallets grants to the Aave Arc market by calling `addPermissions()` and `removePermissions()` contract methods, respectively. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave community voted on the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmYQEh4vstJADjSK2b8nyK1otFG6R4rh9VHszU5xUEw26S) with Yes 149.2k AAVE (98.33%) and No 2.54k AAVE (1.67%).\n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code)\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n- Adds [Fireblocks](https://etherscan.io/address/0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4) as Permission Admin by calling addPermissionAdmins` on the [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract.\n\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4]);`\n\n- Unpause the pool by calling setPoolPause on the [LendingPoolConfigurator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA) contract.\n\n`ILendingPoolConfigurator(0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA).setPoolPause(false);`\n\n- Transfers the EmergencyAdmin role of the system to the [ArcTimelock's Veto DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x33B09130b035d6D7e57d76fEa0873d9545FA7557).\n\n`provider.setEmergencyAdmin(ARC_TIMELOCK_VETO_DAO_ADDRESS);`\n\n- Transfers ownership of the system to the [ARC Market Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x23c155C1c1ecB18a86921Da29802292f1d282c68) temporarily until handed over to Aave Governance.\n\n`provider.transferOwnership(ARC_MARKET_MULTISIG_ADDRESS);`\n\n### Aave Arc Timelock\n\nAave Arc Timelock gives a guardian address the opportunity to cancel an approved governance action prior to its execution.\nThe timelock implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/arc-timelock).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLlama proposes listing 1INCH, the governance token of the 1inch Network, on Aave v2 mainnet as collateral with borrowing enabled. The risk parameters detailed within have been provided by Gauntlet. \n\n## Abstract\n\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol v1. The 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space.\n\nListing 1INCH on Aave v2 will enable lenders to receive yield and borrowers of 1INCH to partake in 1inch’s tokenomics to vote and be reimbursed their gas cost to perform swaps on 1inch’s Aggregation Platform.\n\n## Motivation\n\nListing 1INCH on the Aave v2 market would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage and recognise the efforts of the 1inch team for being supportive of Aave since before v1.  \n\nSince the original proposal to list 1INCH the team has removed minting roles on the token, introduced a progressive vesting schedule and created use cases for aTokens. The 1INCH token is supported by a Chainlink oracle feed and has favourable on-chain liquidity conditions.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal initializes the 1INCH reserve, enables variable borrowing, sets a reserve factor and configures the reserve as collateral. As needed, it also connects a price source on the AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nLink to Test Cases: [End-to-end test suite](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/blob/master/src/test/Validation1InchListing.sol), [aToken/stableDebtToken/variableDebtToken verification](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/tree/master/diffs), [deployment script](https://github.com/defijesus/bdg-labs-aave-v2-listings/blob/master/scripts/1InchListingPayload.s.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe recommend the following risk parameters.\n\n### Risk Parameters:\n\nLTV 40%\n\nLiquidation Threshold 50%\n\nLiquidation Bonus 8.5%\n\nReserve Factor 20%\n\n### Variable Interest Rate Parameters:\n\nUOptimal 45%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 7%\n\nR_s2 300%\n\n\nThe snapshot vote to add 1INCH on Aave v2 mainnet market can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2ea76814a0dfcad7ea1a7b3c597f059a8d574f8143886b23043918998505f5a7).  \n\n\n- [ProposalPayload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd417d07c20e31f6e129fa68182054b641fbec8bd#code)\n- [aINCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x130FBED7dBA2b370f0F93b0Caea2cfD9b811D66D#code)\n- [Variable Debt 1INCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d3707566Ee8a0ed6DE424a262050C7587da8152#code)\n- [Stable Debt 1INCH implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9C2114Bf70774C36E9b8d6c790c9C14FF0d6799E#code)\n- [Interest rate strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2eD1eCE1c13455Ce9299d35D3B00358529f3Dc8#code) \n- [1INCH/ETH price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It expired before execution so we need to re-propose it to the Aave community.\n\nThis AIP is the combination of two ARCs presented on the Aave Governance Forum. This proposal performs the initial step of the [Llama treasury management strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797) and also includes [Index Coop’s enable borrowing of DPI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-enable-borrowing-of-dpi-on-aave-markets/6976) proposal. \n\nThe Llama proposal entails re-routing the current and future revenue from the mainnet V1 Reserve Factor to the mainnet V2 Reserve Factor. The Index Coop proposal re-enables users to borrow DPI after it was disable by [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr). \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends consolidating revenue earned on all Aave markets on mainnet into a single Reserve Factor (RF). This proposal consolidates past and future Aave mainnet V1 market revenue into the mainnet V2 RF. In the future, other aspects of the Llama treasury management proposal will be implemented through separate AIPs.\n\nThis proposal is broken into two parts, the second part is to enable borrowing of DPI. The borrowing of DPI was disabled via [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr) along with xSUSHI. Shortly after enacting AIP-44, DPI was found to be safe. This proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~$102.7M of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time. \n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around [~$435K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$26.88M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around $27.32M.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1 and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nWithin this proposal, the assets held with the Aave mainnet V1 RF are to be transferred to the Aave mainnet V2 RF. All future revenue from the V1 deployment will now automatically accrue in the V2 RF upon implementation of this proposal. Post implementation of this proposal, the V1 RF is not expected to accrue any future revenue.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60).\n\n### Part B - Enable Borrowing DPI\n\nThe recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing. \n\nThe details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, [AIP-31](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/27-Qme2d9yZ81j3JkQ4ecr7BSZv4Rvh5NyU36um48f5S75CQG). For any additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/refactor-aave-rf/\n\n## Implementation\n\nAave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor: `0xE3d9988F676457123C5fD01297605efdD0Cba1ae`\nAave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c`\n\nBy calling `function execute()` and `function distributeTokens()` on the ProposalPayload contract, the token distributor will be upgraded to send all funds to the `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, the AAVE protocol v1's token distributor will be set to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, DPI borrowing will be enabled and all large balances from the `Aave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor` will be distributed to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`.

The two quarter pilot program had a grants budget of $1 million and an operating budget of $250,000 per quarter. The pilot program has awarded $1.17m to 38 grant recipients and made the initial steps to put the grants process and the protocol in the hands of the community.\n\nMoving forward we propose renewing Aave Grants DAO with an increased grants budget of $2 million and an operations budget of $2 million per quarter. With the increased budget we will increase the number of larger community grants, fund non-developer grants including sponsorship and community events, and work to decentralize the grants process.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAGD’s mission is to build a thriving ecosystem of contributors for Aave. We provide grants to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Aave and its ecosystem. We hope to be at the forefront of ecosystem development at Aave. Ensuring a constant influx of talented builders is critical to Aave’s growth.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/aave/aave-grants-update-and-renewal\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to transfer funds from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve, the proposal will target the contract ControllerAaveEcosystemReserve and call the function `transfer(IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n**Target Contract**\n\nControllerAaveEcosystemReserve = [0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93)\n\n**Transfer Parameters**\n\ntoken = the aave token [0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9)\n\nrecipient = the grants dao multi-sig = [0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0)\n\namount = $2 million / ($189.67 / aave) = 10544.63 adjust for decimals = 10544630000000000000000\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "description": "\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) is to authorize the Guardian to hold the emergency keys for V2 of the Aave Protocol, just as the Guardian holds the keys for new deployments of the Aave Protocol. These keys will allow the Guardian to pause the protocol in case of an unforeseen event, such as an exploit or other emergency.\n\nThe Guardian – a community multisig comprised of elected, reputable members of the Aave community – was established to protect the Aave Protocol in a number of ways, including against potential governance takeovers by centralized actors. Recently, the Aave community voted in favor of the Guardian holding the admin keys for new deployments of the Aave Protocol on different networks such as Avalanche.\n\nConsistent with its purpose to protect the Aave Protocol, the Guardian should hold the emergency keys for all deployments of the Aave Protocol in order to ensure security and safety for the Aave ecosystem. This will allow a more rapid response in the event of an exploit or emergency. As you know, the Guardians were a community-elected set of DeFi participants, builders, and capital allocators (see here for more info). These individuals are active contributors in the space, and are prepared to act at a moment’s notice to help the community and ecosystem mitigate risk.\n\nAlthough Aave Governance makes all decisions regarding the Aave Protocol, the need to act quickly in the case of an unanticipated event points to having the Guardian – a smaller DAO / multisig of ten – hold the emergency keys in order to be able protect the Aave Protocol and its users.\n\nTo protect the Aave Protocol from malicious actors, this AIP sets forth a proposal to authorize the Community Guardian to hold the emergency keys for all deployments of the Aave Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP is the combination of two ARCs presented on the Aave Governance Forum. This proposal performs the initial step of the [Llama treasury management strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797) and also includes [Index Coop’s enable borrowing of DPI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-enable-borrowing-of-dpi-on-aave-markets/6976) proposal. \n\nThe Llama proposal entails re-routing the current and future revenue from the mainnet V1 Reserve Factor to the mainnet V2 Reserve Factor. The Index Coop proposal re-enables users to borrow DPI after it was disable by [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr). \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends consolidating revenue earned on all Aave markets on mainnet into a single Reserve Factor (RF). This proposal consolidates past and future Aave mainnet V1 market revenue into the mainnet V2 RF. In the future, other aspects of the Llama treasury management proposal will be implemented through separate AIPs.\n\nThis proposal is broken into two parts, the second part is to enable borrowing of DPI. The borrowing of DPI was disabled via [AIP-44](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr) along with xSUSHI. Shortly after enacting AIP-44, DPI was found to be safe. This proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~$102.7M of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time. \n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around [~$435K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$26.88M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around $27.32M.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Part A - Consolidate Aave Mainnet V1 and V2 Reserve Factors\n\nWithin this proposal, the assets held with the Aave mainnet V1 RF are to be transferred to the Aave mainnet V2 RF. All future revenue from the V1 deployment will now automatically accrue in the V2 RF upon implementation of this proposal. Post implementation of this proposal, the V1 RF is not expected to accrue any future revenue.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60).\n\n### Part B - Enable Borrowing DPI\n\nThe recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing. \n\nThe details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, [AIP-31](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/27-Qme2d9yZ81j3JkQ4ecr7BSZv4Rvh5NyU36um48f5S75CQG). For any additional information see Index Coop’s website: https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/refactor-aave-rf/\n\n## Implementation\n\nAave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor: `0xE3d9988F676457123C5fD01297605efdD0Cba1ae`\nAave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c`\n\nBy calling `function execute()` and `function distributeTokens()` on the ProposalPayload contract, the token distributor will be upgraded to send all funds to the `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, the AAVE protocol v1's token distributor will be set to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`, DPI borrowing will be enabled and all large balances from the `Aave mainnet V1 Reserve Factor` will be distributed to `Aave mainnet V2 Reserve Factor`.

    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAs stated in the [Aavenomics paper](https://aave.com/Aavenomics.pdf), the AAVE asset is designed to become the center of gravity for Aave governance and the protocol.\n\n\nThe DeFi decentralized ethos has been mostly achieved with protocols on the financial side, creating an ecosystem of financial applications with users in control of their own assets. However, we believe that is only the halfway point of the decentralization objective. Users should also be be in control of the protocol. The AAVE asset is designed for this purpose. This AIP is the first binding step towards the community ownership of the Aave Protocol.\n\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will slowly deprecate the LEND asset in favour of the AAVE asset. As stated in the Aavenomics, this token upgrade will also create the Ecosystem Reserve (ER), the Safety Module (SM), and start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution. The Safety Module is designed as an additional line of defense for Aave liquidity providers and as a way for AAVE holders to \"stake\" their assets in exchange for a range of rewards.\n\n\nThis AIP's purpose is also to dedicate a part of the ER to a kickstart incentives for the Safety Module's first quarterly staker distribution.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Migration of LEND -> AAVE asset with the migration contract\n- Activation of the quarterly plan of Safety Incentives (SI) allocation\n- Start of the Safety Module with initial SI rewards of 400 AAVE/day\n\n## Safety Incentives Schedule\n\nThe bootstrapping phase of the Safety Module will be a step-by-step process in 2 main phases:\n- Initial bootstrapping with launch of the Safety Module, the ability to stake and earn AAVE rewards, but no activation of the protocol protection (i.e slashing) and thus risk-free for stakers.\n- Activation of the Safety Module, a new line of defense for the Aave Protocol users.\n\nThe initial bootstrapping phase rationale is designed to have lower rewards and a risk-free environment to allow the majority of LEND holders to migrate at their own pace. This encourages a careful approach while interacting with critical migration and staking smart-contracts.\n\nAfter activation of the Safety Module, the Aave governance can adjust the Safety Incentive (SI) schedule and emissions rate.\n\nThe Safety Incentive's allocation quarterly date should be voted on before the end of the 3 months (90 days) distribution schedule. In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Mainnet addresses and relevant notes\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the migration process :\n\n- [0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52) AaveProtoGovernance : the governance contract\n- [0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#code) AAVE token contract : the ERC20 AAVE token contract\n- [0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5) StakedAave : The Staking contract for AAVE\n- [0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4) LendToAaveMigrator : The migration contract\n- [0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005) AaveGenesisPayloadProposal : Contract in charge of enforcement of the AIP outcome\n- [0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007) AaveGenesisExecutor : Contract enforcing a 24h delay on enforcement of AIP outcome to allow the community to be prepared to migrate\n- [0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code) AaveIncentivesVault : Ecosystem Reserve\n\n\nThe migration process for every LEND holder will leverage the method `migrateFromLend()` with a simple `uint256` input of the amount.

We are currently not fully decentralized but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are bound to respect all of the governance votes. We do plan to be a real DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by community.\n\nxSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the swaps happening on Sushiswap and should also benefits from all of the future revenues streams from upcoming platforms such as Bento-Miso-Gusoku-Deriswap and more.\n\nThe current yield on this asset alone is hovering around 10-40% APY with over $100MM locked in the Sushibar making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for adding xSushi to the AAVE V2 market is simple; xSushi is a popular yield bearing asset but is currently incapable of being utilized for borrowing or lending.\n\nSUSHI can currently be borrowed and lent on [cream.finance](https://app.cream.finance/). However, xSushi cannot be borrowed or lent on any platform currently. By allowing xSushi to be borrowed and lent on AAVE v2, this will allow xSushi holders to access the liquidity of their platform\n\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\n\n## Test Cases\n\n*see implementation*\n\n## Implementation\nAAVE does not use TWAP oracle and xSushi does not have sufficient liquidity on centralized exchanges we will calculate the xSushi using the existing oracle of SUSHI and applying a calculated exchange rate.\n\nThe price oracle for xSushi will calculate the price using a SUSHI price oracle multiplied by the exchange rate for SUSHI<>xSushi.\n\n`xSushiPrice = sushiPrice * exchangeRate`\n\nTo calculate the exchange rate we will check the SUSHI balance of the xSushi contract.\n\nAn example implementation of exchange rate calculation can be found below\n\n```js\nlet sushi = new ethers.Contract('0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalSushiStakedinXSushi = await sushi.methods.balanceOf('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272').call()\n\nlet xSushi = new ethers.Contract('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalXSushiSupply = await xSushi.methods.totalSupply().call()\n\nlet exchangeRate = totalSushiStakedinBar.div(totalXSushiSupply)\n```\n\nAt the request of the AAVE team we have included a convenience contract for returning the exchange rate of Sushi -> xSushi exchange rate.\n\n[Exchange Rate contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE8061286f2975EF38c8F70607eD839Fc9C0f0090#readContract)\n[Exchange Rate contract repo](https://github.com/sushiswap/xsushi-exchange-rate)\n\nValues from the `getExchangeRate()` method are returned as `uint256` values with a pecision of `10**18`\n\nLastly, xSushi is explicitly convertible for SUSHI at the exchange rate described above. Fees are paid as SUSHI to xSushi holders and collected into a pool of SUSHI, where each xSushi token represents a proportional share in the pool size. In essence SUSHI fees paid are accumulated to the xSushi which are not redeemable without the destruction of the underlying xSushi.\n\nSince debts incurred on AAVE would require that the debt be repaid in xSushi, the fees that are accumulated are safe from being harvested.\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Peckshield & Quantstamp](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/sushiswap-process-quality-audit#audits)\n\n[**AAVE Community xSushi Risk Assement**](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-xsushi/1794/16)\n\n![Screenshot 2021-01-05 at 19.56.10](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/1X/e35ebb4c429ea6e1162d1fd6faf7d7b624287a14_2_690x184.png)\n\nSushiSwap is a DEX forked of Uniswap that grew very fast, now at $1.6B of TVL, thanks to generous liquidity mining incentives.

This has generated a consistent amount of stable rate debt, which results in frictions for the V1 liquidity providers and integrators that still rely on Aave V1 for their deposits.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Aave governance, new stable rates loans positions will be disabled for Aave V1.\n\nThe rebalancing mechanism will also be updated to an enforced swap to variable rates. Which means, in case of extremely high borrowing pressure on the stablecoins reserves, users at stable rate will be migrated to variable until rebalancing conditions are not satisfied anymore.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nDeactivation of the ability to open new stable rate borrowing positions on Aave V1 and update of the rebalance mechanism\n\n## Implementations details\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x6a46c03c861cab74c8a213983b7eb295234c16b3#code\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n\n- Updates the LendingPool implementation to \n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0xDB9217fad3c1463093fc2801Dd0a22C930850A61#code\n\n- Updates the LendingPoolCore implementation to\n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0x2847A5D7Ce69790cb40471d454FEB21A0bE1F2e3#code\n\n  These contract updates are needed to update the implementation of the rebalanceStableRate() function\n\n- Execute disableReserveStableBorrowRate() in all the assets listed on the protocol V1\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

It is an uncollateralized financial primitive with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. Ample targets the 2019 USD. Like Bitcoin, Ample is non-dilutive but it has a long-term unit of account that unlocks safe denomination of debt. The goal of Ampleforth is to create a building block for a safer, more resilient financial ecosystem.\n\nBeing able to borrow and lend AMPL would enable holders to:\n\n- Utilize a new, low-correlated collateral asset which could reduce risk\n- Decrease exposure to rebases in exchange for income from interest\n- Use a non-collateralized asset that “[borrows like a stablecoin](https://medium.com/ampleforth/elastic-finance-lending-213e02de0583)\"\n- Create leveraged AMPL trades and unlock derivatives\n- Create interest bearing AMPL that can be staked in other protocols\n- Increase exposure to AMPL & farming\n\n## Motivation\nAMPL total supply and balances change once every 24 hours (at 2am UTC) based on market price. The supply change factor is the same for all holders. Because of that, lending and borrowing AMPL behaves differently from fixed supply tokens.\n\nThe desired behavior is for the borrow amount (loan) to stay the same after a rebase. The unborrowed tokens deposited in the Aave protocol still get exposed to rebase just like any other contract wallet. This means aAMPLs \"partially rebase\", in accordance with the utilization ratio.\n\nThe AMPL AToken functionally behaves similarly to every other AToken. It maintains a 1:1 peg with the underlying AMPL.\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder, developer\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token\nSee Summary\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market?\n\nThe asset will be listed in the current AAVE V2 market.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions\n\nAmpleforth launched in July, 2019. Since then, Ample has executed over 550 days of rebases. The network was subject to extreme growth and volatility following the launch of the Geyser liquidity mining program in July 2020. It has shown resilience with a lifetime median price of $1.00 and average price of $1.02 (vs target price of $1.02). There are currently over 22K holders and is a top 100 currency by Market Cap.\n\nOnchain network history viewable on [Dashboard](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/).\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAmple aims to be a financial building block that supports a robust and stable financial ecosystem. Borrowing and lending is a critical layer of this stack. [Current roadmap](https://www.ampleforth.org/roadmap/).\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nAmple has developed deep liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Mooniswap, and a Smart Pool on Balancer through its liquidity mining program.\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ampleforth#markets\n\n7. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nLinks above\n\n8. Risk Assessment and Parameter suggestions\n\nAMPL has been evaluated as low technical risk because it doesn't have any potential of infinite or uncontrolled minting.\n\nGiven the novel mechanism of rebasing, it will only be used as a borrowing currency for the time being. An evalution of whether to give it collateral status will be performed afterward.\n\nA 3rd party Audit report from Peckshield can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/50290685aa3b68eea18f4a908748aafb05db96ab/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-aAMPL-v1.0.pdf).\n\nAfter some recommendations from Aave devs, we made small updates to the implementation. This included no behavioral changes but included using a different math library and method of initializating configuration. We then ran a second round of audits with Peckshield that raised no new issues.\n\nInternal testing was performed with a mainnet fork.\n\nWe launched an [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/ampleforth/) for the aToken with a competitive $100K reward for critical vulnerabilities. This has also raised no issues.\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\nWe implement a custom AToken, StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken for AMPL. The StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken implementations make no functional changes to the generic implementation. When the debt tokens are minted and burned, it performs some additional book-keeping to keep track of the totalScaledAMPL (fixed AMPL denomination, ie Gons) borrowed at any-time. The new getAMPLBorrowData method returns the totalScaledAMPL and totalScaledSupply which are used for AAmplToken math.\n\nGeneric AToken has a private balance and public balance. The public balance returned by balanceOf is multiplied by an interest rate factor. The aAMPL works the same way but the AAmplInternal balance is multiplied by another factor, which accounts for the underlying AMPL rebasing and the amount of AMPL unborrowed.\n\n### Code\nAAMPL token address: 0x6fBC3BE5ee5273598d1491D41bB45F6d05a7541A\nCode verified [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6fBC3BE5ee5273598d1491D41bB45F6d05a7541A#code)\n\nSteps the proposal will execute:\n1. Start a vote to add aAMPL as a new asset.\n\n### Test Cases\n- [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a4zd7UL-U5Xrme9b0X5B39nJzjrFwfG1?usp=sharing) of test cases\n- Unit tests included with code change provide full coverage for all borrow, repay, and rebase flows.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Standard technical risks of smart contracts apply to the AToken implementation.\n- Market risk resulting from first borrow/lending market for a rebasing currency.\n",

    "description": "\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n\nAdd depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market. renFIL is a wrapped version of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) using [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/).\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) brings decentralized storage to DeFi, and [renFIL](https://renproject.io/) allows all types of new decentralized applications to be built to further the space. But these applications need a robust lending market to thrive, so storage miners can borrow renFIL/FIL to stake and FIL holders can earn a return on their holdings.\n\nThis proposal describes adding depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market to unlock these new applications, expose the Filecoin community to Aave, and create a large new market on the protocol. [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/) was chosen as the tokenization service because it is already managing large bridges in production, including [$301 million in renBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renbtc) as of this writing. Collateral support for renFIL may be added later, but we recommend waiting for more price stability of FIL and renFIL before enabling.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nFilecoin, and by extension, renFIL is unlike any other digital asset currently available in the Aave market, as it allows the purchase of hosting space on the permissionless Filecoin network. As a result, being able to lend and borrow renFIL will unlock many new DeFi applications, including:\n\n* Storage mining syndicates\n* Data markets\n* Shared UIs/images/content\n* Lossless capital hosting\n\nJust see the recent [EthGlobal<>Protocol Labs Hackathon](https://hack.ethglobal.co/hackfs/showcase) and [Filecoin Launchpad](https://www.filecoinlaunchpad.co/)for hints of what is possible at the intersection of Filecoin+DeFi. The Filecoin community is massive and growing everyday, however, many of the participants are unfamiliar with Aave and DeFi. Adding renFIL to Aave would dramatically increase support for these efforts, would bring Filecoin users/developers into the Aave ecosystem, and allow capital, yield, and value to accrue to Aave participants.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n### Project\nFilecoin is a distributed storage network based on a blockchain mechanism. Filecoin miners can elect to provide storage capacity for the network, and thereby earn units of the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) by periodically producing cryptographic proofs that certify that they are providing the capacity specified. In addition, Filecoin enables parties to exchange FIL currency through transactions recorded in a shared ledger on the Filecoin blockchain. Rather than using Nakamoto-style proof of work to maintain consensus on the chain, however, Filecoin uses proof of storage itself: a miner’s power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage it provides.\n\nFilecoin was founded in 2015 by [Juan Benet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet), has been backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures, and its mainnet went live on October 15, 2020. The network is governed by the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for Decentralised Web.\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe REN token is already supported in the Aave market, and renBTC is one of the most popular cross-chain tokens today. In unifying the Filecoin and DeFi ecosystems, Ren protocol is a natural bridge and has the technical expertise and experience to get the job down securely and safely.\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\nThe Filecoin price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes both [FIL/ETH and FIL/USD feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nThe renFIL token will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following strategy params are proposed:\n\n```\nIReserveParams = {\n  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  baseVariableBorrowRate: '0',\n  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.07).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(3).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  stableRateSlope1: '0',\n  stableRateSlope2: '0',\n  baseLTVAsCollateral: '0',\n  liquidationThreshold: '0',\n  liquidationBonus: '0',\n  borrowingEnabled: true,\n  stableBorrowRateEnabled: false,\n  reserveDecimals: '18',\n  aTokenImpl: eContractid.AToken,\n  reserveFactor: '3500'\n};\n```\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n```\n    New interest bearing asset deployed on main:\n    Interest bearing aRENFIL address: 0x5CAF29fD8efbe4ED0cfc43A8a211B276E9889583\n    Variable Debt variableDebtRENFIL address: 0x4B20f007d0c1567Ca8a6e80B8a8EE19Ac59C6a08\n    Stable Debt stableDebtRENFIL address: 0xf22b80D58a7cCDEd772E0997AE90a6C77940B051\n    Strategy Implementation for RENFIL address: 0xb140cb1306B396c658A5438602b6857842E1E98a\n```\n\n### Test Cases\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Ren Protocol audits from ChainSecurity, ConsenSys Diligence, and Trail of Bits](https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki/Audits)\n\n[Filecoin audits and bug bounty](https://security.filecoin.io/)\n\n[AAVE Community renFIL Risk Assement](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-renfil-filecoin/1059/17?u=corbpage)\n\n![renFIL Risk Screenshot](../assets/AIP-add_renFIL_support/renFIL_risk_screenshot.png)\n\n[**RenFIL Smart contract Risk**](https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd5147bc8e386d91cc5dbe72099dac6c9b99276f5): **C**\n\nRenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Filecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains. Since launch, RenVM has processed around $1.5B in total volume of Bitcoin, Filecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash going to and from Ethereum. The smart contract risks of RenFIL are mitigated by those of RenBTC which has been battle tested by the markets.\n\nTechnically, renFIL is a proxied token standard ERC with some features on top:\n\n* Mechanism of exchange rate (similar to Aave slashing)\n* Permit for approvals\n* Recovery of other tokens sent to the contract\n\n**RenFIL Counterparty Risk: C**\n\nThere is a proxy admin which can update all the logic of the contract with a 7 days timelock controller by a multisig, controlled by the team. Even with 7 days, it may be impossible to mitigate the consequences of a contract upgrade with minting for example.\n\nFurthermore there is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) with permissions to mint, burn, change the exchange rate and decide which tokens sent by mistake to the renFIL contract are recoverable.\n\nThis results in the capability to burn tokens of a particular address (potentially the ones contained in aToken) and the change of the implementation under the proxy.\n\n[RenFIL Market 1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renfil): **Risk B (based on FIL)**\n\nRenFIL market capitalisation is unknown with very little liquidity in the markets. The redemption process is permissionless enabling smooth liquidations into the liquidity of FIL.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nGiven the centralisation of RenFIL it can only be listed as borrow asset.\n\nReserve Factor 35%\n\n**Variable Interest Rate Model** \n\nUOptimal 80% (since not a collateral)\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 7%\n\nR_s2 300%\n\n![renFIL Interest Rate Model](../assets/AIP-add_renFIL_support/renFIL_risk_graph.png)\n\n## References\n* [Filecoin Website](https://filecoin.io/)\n* [Filecoin Spec](https://spec.filecoin.io/)\n* [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/)\n* [renFIL Token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xD5147bc8e386d91Cc5DBE72099DAC6C9b99276F5)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "description": "\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe that a well designed LM program can accomplish the following:\n\nGrow lending and borrowing activity in targeted markets: With almost every major DeFi protocol launching a liquidity mining program, we believe it would be advantageous for Aave to utilize part of the Ecosystem Reserve to drive lending and borrowing activity across markets. Distributing AAVE to borrowers and lenders acts as an added incentive to attract more capital. The distribution can become more targeted over time. For example, certain markets may need more AAVE than others based on liquidity, utilization, and maturity of the market.\n\nBroader distribution and protocol decentralization: Rewarding AAVE to users of the protocol improves the distribution of the AAVE token. This gets AAVE into the hands of more users, further decentralizing the protocol.\n\nDeprecating Aave v1: Due to high gas fees and a lack of incentive to migrate, Aave v1 still contains approximately 40% of the value locked in the broader Aave protocol. By introducing liquidity mining rewards only on Aave v2, liquidity providers and borrowers will naturally migrate toward the optimized version. Declining liquidity on Aave v1 will facilitate a gradual deprecation of this iteration of the protocol, allowing more development activity to be directed at Aave v2.\n\nThis program is being proposed as a beta to further investigate how the inclusion of liquidity mining rewards will benefit the Aave ecosystem. From a supply perspective, this distribution results in only 5% of the fully diluted AAVE supply released each year. This enables Aave to experiment with liquidity mining rewards while saving the majority of the ecosystem reserves for other growth initiatives and grants. If this AIP passes, the Aave community can reflect on total supply/borrow and utilization by market to further refine the distribution program.\n\nThe forum [poll](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-introduce-liquidity-incentives-for-aave-v2/2340/27) closed with 62% of participants supportive of introducing rewards.\n\n## AIP rationale\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. While Aave has seen success without rewards so far, this program would attempt to supercharge its growth at a relatively low cost to the treasury and AAVE holders.\n\nThis distribution strategy rewards markets based on borrow demand. Markets with higher dollar value borrowed receive a higher share of the daily stkAAVE rewards. stkAAVE will be allocated at a 50/50 ratio between lenders and borrowers across stablecoin markets. In WBTC and ETH markets, the ratio between lenders and borrowers will be 95/5 to discourage riskier borrowing activity.\n\nstkAAVE will be rewarded instead of AAVE to align long-term incentives, disincentivize speculative farmers, and allow users to earn an underlying yield on top of the AAVE they earn. This helps align LPs by giving them more governance weight upfront and secure the protocol by increasing the amount of AAVE staked in the Safety Module. LPs then immediately earn a staking yield on their vested AAVE.\n\nstkAAVE requires a 10 day cooldown period. The cooldown period must be started before LPs can unstake their AAVE. After the cooldown period, users have a 2 day window to unstake.\n\nTo simplify the implementation and allow the community to analyze the distribution first, this proposal does not include a vesting component. As we approach the target end date for the LM program, we encourage the community to explore any vesting structures for stkAAVE.\n\nWe propose 7/15/21 as the target end date for this liquidity mining program. A mid-July end date gives the community 3 months of activity to analyze before voting to end, continue, or adjust the LM program.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nThe purpose of this AIP is to introduce liquidity mining rewards for Aave v2.\n\nThis AIP would distribute 2,200 Staked AAVE (stkAAVE) per day, representing around 1M$ in rewards distributed daily to lenders and borrowers. Users will receive stkAAVE.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across the following markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market:\n\n![Aave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/AIP-16/aip16-img.png)\n\n\n$ Value as of 3/22/21\n\nThis program is structured as a beta, with the opportunity to track protocol activity and refine the distribution in the future.\n\nThe distribution has a target end date of 7/15/21. The community will be able to review the results of the LM program and adjust any parameters accordingly.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDistribute 2,200 stkAAVE daily from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/incentives-policy-and-aave-reserve) to borrowers and lenders\n\nEcosystem Reserve contract : https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code\n\n## Implementations details\n\nProposal contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8#code\n\nThe proposal will update the aDAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementations and the variableDebt DAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementation to set the Incentives controller to https://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8.

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIntroduce the Aave Grants DAO (AGD) to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose starting a community-led grants DAO to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community, with a focus on empowering a wider network of community developers. The pilot program will be over two quarters. The grants budget will be $1 million per quarter and the operating budget will be $250,000 over two quarters. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. A committee of 8 members, including one lead, will oversee the grants program. \n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants DAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave has an ecosystem reserve of $1.2B or 2.7m AAVE as of 4/27/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.\n\nTo promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program called Aave Grants DAO.\n\nThe goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development.\n\nGiven the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee which has the power to administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur proposal is inspired by the grants programs of Compound and Uniswap, which have both received approvals to deploy $1m and $750k per quarter, respectively.\n\nWe propose to run the pilot grants program over two quarters. We request a max grants budget of $2m and a max operating budget of $250k. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program.\n\nThere will be two types of grants that the grants committee can approve:\n1. Rapid grants: < $100k, simple process to apply for a grant to AGD, relatively quick grant decision\n2. Community grants: $100k-$500k, initial application followed by posting proposal on governance forum, committee can decide to approve these grants based on feedback from community\n\nContributors can also seek grants over $500k but they will not go through the committee. They will have to be posted on Aave’s governance forum and approved through an on-chain vote.\n\nThe expenses will be priced in USD terms at the beginning of each quarter. The reviewers will ensure that all unspent funds will be returned to the Ecosystem Reserve at the conclusion of the pilot. If the program is underfunded because AAVE’s token price falls significantly, the committee may request the underfunded amount from governance. After running the pilot program for two quarters, the community can vote to continue, modify, or discontinue the program.\n\nApplications will be reviewed and funded on a rolling basis. The applications approved and funded within each quarter will form a funding round which will be tracked, supported and documented.\n\nDocumentation of results will be made available to the community at the end of each round, at which point we will solicit feedback from the community. The idea is to start with a rough MVP and evolve through community feedback. We expect to learn a lot about how to do this right in the first 2 quarters and anticipate making changes to the grants program over time through subsequent proposals.\n\n## Committee Members\n\nWe propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.\n\nReviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.\n\nBoth the lead and the reviewers will serve for a period of two quarters. After two quarters, the grants program and the committee member positions will be up for renewal. This will be put up on the governance forum for a discussion and subsequent on-chain vote.\n\nMembers may be replaced during the pilot program, for example, if they find they are not able to dedicate sufficient time to the program. We aim to be as transparent as possible and get feedback on the Aave forum if there are any changes to the committee during the program.\n\nThe committee is composed as follows:\n\nLead: [Shreyas Hariharan](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) - Llama\n\nShreyas is the founder of Llama, which helps DeFi protocols and DAOs manage their treasury. He has actively worked on treasury spending, allocation, and reporting. He is working on a treasury strategy for Uniswap and serving as a reviewer for Uniswap grants. As an Aave community member and token holder, he is excited to help grow the Aave ecosystem through the grants program.\n\nReviewers:\n\n1. [Aleks Larsen](https://twitter.com/_alekslarsen) - Blockchain Capital\n2. [Jose Maria Macedo](https://twitter.com/ZeMariaMacedo) - Delphi Digital\n3. [Imran Khan](https://twitter.com/lmrankhan) - DeFi Alliance\n4. [Maggie Love](https://twitter.com/melove_07) - W3BCLOUD and SheFi\n5. [Corbin Page](https://twitter.com/corbpage) - ConsenSys Codefi\n6. [Nick Cannon](https://twitter.com/inkymaze) - Gauntlet\n7. [Calvin Chu](https://twitter.com/calchulus) - Independent\n\n## Budget\n\nWe request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.\n\nPayments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/30/21, the lead will be paid on 5/30/21, and the again on 6/30/21 and 7/30/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.\n\nAny changes to the AGD including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget and committee compensation will require full quorum.\n\n## Committee Compensation\n\nWe suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGD multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.\n\nThe time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.\n\n## Priorities\n\nTo help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:\n\n1. Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the Aave protocol)\n2. Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)\n3. Developer tooling\n4. Community (marketing and educational)\n5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem\n6. Code audits\n7. Events and hackathons\n8. Bounties\n\n## What does success look like?\n\nWe will evaluate the success of the program against the following criteria:\n\nMeasurable criteria:\n\n1. Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter-over-quarter\n2. Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded\n3. Growth in community engagement (e.g. increased activity on forums, Discord, etc.)\n4. Growth in Aave pools driven by applications funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, borrow activity, and unique addresses due to apps funded by grants)\n\nSubjective criteria:\n\n1. Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community\n2. Improvement to the Aave protocol’s brand and positioning in the market\n\n## Timeline / Process\n\nWe will organize grant recipients into two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants disbursed during a given 3-month period become part of the corresponding round. Round 1 will be for three months from the day the grants proposal has been approved. For example, if the proposal is approved on 4/30/2021, Round 1 of the grants program will be from 4/30/2021 to 7/30/2021 and Round 2 of the grants program will be from 7/30/2021 to 10/30/2021.\n\nIf approved, starting immediately after a proposal is ratified, AGD will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. The grants committee will determine on how funding is to be disbursed (e.g. milestones, upfront, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. In general, the goal will be to align long-term incentives with the interests of the Aave community and AAVE holders.\n\nAt the end of each round, the committee is responsible for sharing all the grant recipients along with amounts and descriptions as part of a transparent quarterly review process. The end of the Round 2 marks the end of the pilot. At that point, the community will decide based on the results of the first two rounds whether or not to continue funding AGD (in the same or an amended form).\n\nMost grants will have 1-2 milestones and recipients will receive about half the grant upfront and half on the completion of a milestone. For more complex projects or larger grants, there may be several milestones and payments could be split across these milestones. AGD will get progress updates from teams and assess the completion of these milestones. This ensures downside protection for the AGD in case the project is unsuccessful or needs to pivot.\n\nThe grants will primarily be focused on projects working to improve the Aave protocol. However, a small portion of the budget (5-10%) may be allocated to select projects with a wider scope (e.g. ETH scalability).\n\nIf AGD has distributed all grants but has more promising projects to fund, it can propose increasing the budget to governance. However, it is entirely up to the Aave community to vote on whether to increase the budget.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants committee multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). $1 million will fund the first quarter of Aave grants and $250,000 will cover two quarters of operating expenses for the program. The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The following AIP moves forward the end date of the emission for the AAVE and AAVE/ETH Safety module to continue with the safety incentives program estabilished within the Aavenomics framework.

Up until now, 2.5M LEND have been burned, which will not be converted to AAVE.\nAs a result of the migration, the LEND liquidity has shrunk considerably, which makes it very hard to buy LEND on dexes for the burning.\n\nThe LEND burner currently holds around 20K of funds, distributed across all the different Aave V1 reserves (mostly stablecoins). The burner contract is here https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n\nThis AIP proposes to stop the LEND burning. Instead, the idea is to collect the fees accrued by AAVE V1 to bootstrap a protocol fund. \n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Deprecation of the current TokenDistributor contract\n- Implementation of the following strategy instead of burning:\n  \n  1. Remove the assets conversion to LEND and subsequent burning\n  2. The assets are moved to the AAVE Collector contract, under direct control of the AAVE governance (https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n- The implementation will keep the current redistribution of the referral fees (20% of the total) to continue with the referral distribution as until now.\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- Upgrade of the TokenDistributor contract https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n- Modify the distribute() function as follows:\n\n  1.

Move the assets to 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\nDistribution to the current referral fees wallet will be kept.\n  \n## Proposal data\n\nAIP2 Payload:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b7c3e3ea48f80a78487067cd08b9a8430eb8eb5\n\nNew TokenDistributor Implementation:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x62C936a16905AfC49B589a41d033eE222A2325Ad\n\nAave Collector contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nReflexer Labs has designed a new type of stable asset called RAI, an ETH backed stablecoin with a moving peg. RAI aims to become an autonomous, crypto native and stable unit of account for the DeFi industry.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRAI is an asset backed only by ETH, governance-minimized, and programmed to maintain its own price stability without needing to peg to an external price reference like the USD. We believe these qualities make RAI ideal initially as an alternative to pegged-coins for use in DeFi as collateral and as a stable reserve asset, especially for programs where resilience is critical.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing more trustless, stable assets into Aave money markets will benefit both Aave and the ecosystem as a whole. The addition of RAI will diversify the protocol’s exposure to stable assets beyond traditional dollar-pegged stablecoins and provide enough bandwidth to grow the protocols TVL.\n\nCurrently, more than $4.56B worth of stable asset liquidity on Aave V1 and V2 is centralised (USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, GUSD) while only $1.25B (~25%) is decentralised (DAI, sUSD). While this isn’t inherently a negative, introducing more decentralised, stable assets adds to Aave’s composability and resilience.\n\nRAI also stands to benefit from being able to expand its utility and liquidity across the largest lending protocol in the space, allowing for more experimentation to occur in the ongoing journey towards entirely trustless and decentralized stable-credit.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder of Reflexer.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nRAI is a decentralized non-pegged ETH-back stable asset meant to act as pristine collateral in DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nOther stablecoins are either centralized or pegged to the dollar. RAI is neither of those and aligns perfectly with the ethos of trust-minimized finance.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRAI launched in February and has amassed over $100M in liquidity with $300M in value locked. RAI is governance minimised by design, as well as currently moving towards a grants DAO.\n\n5.How is the asset currently used?\n\nRAI is currently used as a trust-minmized alternative to other stablecoins. The goal is to drive adoption of RAI to be used as collateral in money markets, other synthetic assets, and more.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, RAI minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nRight now the protocol is almost fully upgradeable. This includes anything from oracles, the contract that collects stability fees, the contract that liquidates positions, the one that auctions collateral etc. This is managed through a multisig with a 6 hour delay on any governance action. Managed by the Reflexer core team. The multisig manages the full system and will do so until rai is gov minimized.\n\nOn the other hand, the contract that keeps track of debt and collateral in all Safes (CDPs) cannot be upgraded.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n    Market Cap: $67M\n    24h Volume: $8M\n    Volatility: Very Low\n    Maturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n10K followers on Twitter, 4.7K members on Discord, Github is highly active.\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\n    Date of Deployment: February 13th, 2021\n    Number of Transactions: 40,000+\n    Number of Holders: 2,000+\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe decision to design RAI as it is today came from the desire to achieve three main goals.\n\n1. DeFi Lego\n\n- Fork of MakerDAO’s Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD)\n- Governance-minimized in the Long Run\n- Algorithmic (PI controller) interest rates\n\n2. Self-stabilizing asset-backed credit facility\n\n- Like MakerDAO, users can unlock credit from their ETH\n- Unlike MakerDAO, debt/credit is not fixed at $1. Rather, it fluctuates based on supply and demand\n- RAI’s PI controller updates the system’s moving peg to balance demand for debt vs. credit\n\n3. Reserve asset for DeFi, alternative to pegged coins\n\n- More decentralized than dollar coins like USDC & USDT\n- Independent of USD inflationary monetary policy\n- Avoids being targeted by dollar coin regulation like the “Stable Act”\n- Backed by pure ETH, no centralized collateral\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe RAI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [RAI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nRAI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aRAI: 0xe0065ea37791d336D78fcA0e870D04f700395B8d\n- Variable Debt variableDebtRAI: 0x2cDA07B4a6D9064292DD8d624883f07c27eE01B7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtRAI: 0xf37E202E587c6f63FD70F35C24Eb7f818CC5d01A\n- Strategy Implementation for RAI: 0xA7d4df837926cD55036175AfeF38395d56A64c22\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n\n[OpenZeppelin Audit for the Core Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/open-zeppelin/core-contracts)\n\n[Quantstamp Audits for Periphery Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/quantstamp/helper-contracts)\n\n[Solidified Audit for Periphery Contracts](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-audits/tree/master/solidified/helper-contracts)\n\n**RAI Smart Contract Risk**: **C-**\n\nRAI has been on Mainnet Ethereum for a bit more than 100 days.\n\n**RAI Counterparty Risk**: **C-**\n\nCurrently the RAI protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized by end of summer 2022 according to [this public roadmap](https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide#4-governance-minimization-levels).\n\nRAI currently has 2,063 holders who performed more than 50,000 transfers.\n\n**RAI Market Risk**: **C**\n\nThe current RAI market cap is 33,126,214 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been 8,786,384,63 USD.

    "basename": "AIP-23",
    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWe are proposing to add BarnBridge (BOND) to Aave as collateral.\n\n## Abstract\n\nBarnBridge is building a suite of applications that allows users to mitigate risk across various use cases throughout DeFi. These applications rely on differentiated user profiles, referred to as tranches, in order to create markets for risks such as interest rate fluctuations and asset price volatility. Currently, SMART Yield on Ethereum mainnet has some $290M in TVL, while SMART Exposure and SMART Alpha are slated for Q3 of 2021. The BOND token is used to govern the BarnBridge DAO and allocate protocol resources.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBarnBridge is one of a handful of DAOs noted for its sizable allocation of its own native asset (see: open-orgs.info). It currently holds over 30% of the total BOND supply.\n\nAdding BOND to Aave would provide a mechanism through which the DAO could finance growth, decreasing the need for excessive token distributions. Example use cases include: funding projects building on top of BarnBridge applications, paying salaries to key protocol participants, and hosting bug bounties that earn yield until paid out.\n\nBarnBridge earns fee revenues from both deposits of underlying assets and redemptions of derivative assets. By adding BOND as collateral, the DAO and individual BOND holders can borrow against their position, increasing stablecoin demand and utilization on Aave v2. Additionally, BOND holders can lend out their position for a yield on Aave v2. Given BarnBridge’s direct role as an Aave liquidity provider, the addition of BOND to Aave v2 creates more synergies between Aave and BOND holders.\n\nTo start, it may make sense for BOND to have a conservative LTV and liquidation threshold which can be fine tuned further down the line.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n  \n  - Seed investor in BarnBridge\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n  \n  - BarnBridge is a risk tokenizing protocol. It aims to reduce the risks associated with DeFi, such as inflation risk, market price risk, and cash-flow volatility   risk. By letting users select a risk profile, BarnBridge can redistribute risk via tokenized, liquid tranches. BarnBridge does this with its SMART Yield, SMART   Exposure, and SMART Alpha products, all of which address a specific DeFi risk category.\n\n  - BOND token is a governance token that powers the BarnBridge DAO protocol. BOND is an ERC-20 token. Token holders have the ability to govern the network by       staking their holdings in return for the right to participate in on-chain voting and make decisions on the protocol development.\n\n  - BOND total supply: 10,000,000 (minting function is disabled).\n  - Token contract address: [`0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f)\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the Aave ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n  \n  - By adding BOND as collateral, the DAO and individual BOND holders can borrow against their position, increasing stablecoin demand and utilization on Aave v2. Additionally, BOND holders can lend out their position for a yield on Aave v2. Given BarnBridge’s direct role as an Aave liquidity provider, the addition of BOND to Aave v2 creates more synergies between Aave and BOND holders. BarnBridge currently provides ~$180M in liquidity to Aave v2 and will be launching a similar integration on Polygon in July.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n  \n  - BarnBridge was founded in September 2020. Since that time, BarnBridge succeed in launching the BarnBridge DAO and delivering a SMART Yield product which currently holds $280M+ in TVL with $178M providing to Aave. With the upcoming SMART Yield and SMART Exposure launch on Polygon, followed by the product we call SMART Secret and SMART Alpha (later) BarnBridge will be a full-established protocol with plenty of products and potentially with 1B+ in TVL after all our products launch.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n  \n  - BOND token is currently used for:\n\n     - Staking in BarnBridge DAO to get exposure to voting rights in the DAO.\n     - Liquidity providing on Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Bancor.\n     - Lending on Cream finance.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n  \n  ![BarnBridge BOND emission schedule](../assets/AIP-23/emission.png)\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradeability\n  \n  - Protocol is upgraded by the BarnBridge DAO.  We used the Diamond Standard on a couple parts of the protocol so we could do seamless upgrades.  A users token \"power\" determines their vote weight and control they have in the DAO.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n  \n  - Market cap: $96M\n  - 24h Volume: $5.7M\n  - Volatility: high\n  - Exchanges: Coinbase, Uniswap, Bancor, Gemini\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n  \n  - Twitter: 19.4K\n  - Discord: 6.2K\n  - Medium: 4.1K\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n  \n  - Transactions: 116K\n  - Token holders: 6.3k\n\n## Rationale\n\nBarnBridge will continue to grow as a distributor of Aave v2 stablecoin markets as its SMART Yield integration gains further traction. There are currently ~$180M worth of stablecoins deposited into Aave v2 through SMART Yield. This liquidity is provided without any expectation of being used, meaning BarnBridge is a pure liquidity provider for Aave. BarnBridge is also actively building an integration with Aave’s Polygon market. Future BarnBridge products, including SMART Alpha senior tranches for assets like wBTC and ETH, stand to provide Aave with relatively safer collateral given their ability to mitigate price drawdowns. \n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Contracts\n\n- Interest bearing aBOND address: [`0x170375B4aD477133a36B4961D9bcA6D5BF9C8389`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x170375B4aD477133a36B4961D9bcA6D5BF9C8389)\n- Variable Debt variableDebtBOND address: [`0x21D0366D1D678fCf276954b7D651B9dfeE104D82`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21D0366D1D678fCf276954b7D651B9dfeE104D82)\n- Stable Debt stableDebtBOND address: [`0xb98EF546D1057f9750511FE16cBCC7Eb0FB6451F`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb98EF546D1057f9750511FE16cBCC7Eb0FB6451F)\n- Strategy Implementation for BOND address: [`0x273358d06Ca3862bf3C0691d1C8B4B4d3E906458`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x273358d06Ca3862bf3C0691d1C8B4B4d3E906458)\n\n### Price oracle\n\nThe BOND price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [BOND/ETH](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses) feed, [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd22A54e05410D8d1007c38b5c7A3eD74b855281).\n\n### Interest model\n\n- LTV 25%\n- Liquidation Threshold 35%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 35%\n\nInterest Rate Model\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n\nVariable:\n\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\nStable:\n\n- R_s1 10%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n\n![BarnBridge BOND Aave interest rates](../assets/AIP-23/rate.png)\n\n## References\n\n- *Website*: https://www.BarnBridge.com\n- *DAPP*: https://app.barnbridge.com/\n- *Whitepaper*: https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-Whitepaper\n- *Project Management Portal*: https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-PM\n- *Youtube*: https://www.youtube.com/c/BarnBridge\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Barn_Bridge\n- *BOND token contract*: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0391D2021f89DC339F60Fff84546EA23E337750f\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP is to list PAX for lend/borrow support on Aave.  Paxos Standard (PAX) is one of largest regulated USD-backed stablecoins, and listing on Aave will provide users a highly trustworthy crypto asset to lend and borrow. PAX is issued by a NYDFS regulated financial institution - Paxos Trust Company - and the token itself is also regulated by NYDFS. This oversight ensures PAX is 100% backed by US Dollars or short term government securities (e.g. “t-bills”) at all times (attestations). PAX users are assured to always access their dollars - all PAX reserves are held fully segregated and bankruptcy remote in US bank accounts, which only Paxos-issued tokens can claim. PAX is also the only coin to have received a successful SOC-II audit. We think transparency is a hallmark of DEFI, and PAX’s transparency and trustworthiness will be beneficial for the community. We are excited at the prospect of listing PAX on Aave.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPaxos Standard (PAX) was launched in 2018 and is a USD stablecoin that is 100% backed by US dollars or short term government securities held bankruptcy remote. Paxos issues PAX, and both the company and token are regulated by the NY DFS. Full PAX attestations are completed monthly and posted to www.paxos.com/attestations.\n\nPAX is used in a variety of use cases including as a means of payment for other blockchain-based assets, a trustworthy store-of-value, settlement outside of traditional banking hours, and being lent / borrowed on known CeFi institutions like BlockFi and Celsius. PAX is included in MakerDAO’s pool and is available for trading on DeFi Apps, including Curve and Uniswap. Paxos would like to extend PAX’s functionality through inclusion in Aave’s lend/borrow markets.  Collateral support could be proposed in future AIPs.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nPaxos would like to extend PAX’s functionality in the DeFi space through a listing on Aave. We believe adding PAX will provide users a highly trustworthy crypto asset to lend and borrow. PAX is valuable not only due to its transparency and trustworthiness, but also the range of use cases it supports, including store-of-value, settlement, trading, and peer-to-peer transfer.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nSoftware Engineer employed at Paxos. Paxos Trust Company is a qualified custodian and trust company regulated by NY DFS and is the sole issuer of the PAX token.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nPAX is the most secure, highest regulated stablecoin available. Token was launched in 2018 to facilitate many blockchain-based use-cases such as payments and stable digital storage.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nPAX is valuable to borrow due to its trustworthiness and range of use cases including store of value, settlement, trading, and peer to peer transfer. PAX is also very liquid and can be created and redeemed directly through Paxos, or can be used to trade on CeFi and DeFi exchanges. Paxos additionally plans to request collateral status at a future date.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nPAX was launched on September 10th, 2018. PAX is included in MakerDAO’s pool and is available for trading on DeFi Apps Curve and Uniswap, as well as traded on many different centralized exchanges.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nPAX shares the typical use-cases for USD stablecoins.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nPAX tokens are minted/burned based on client demand. The process for minting and burning has been approved by the NYDFS and is regularly audited by a third party. Full monthly attestations are available on the Paxos website. Market cap fluctuates as users purchase and redeem PAX.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n   \n   *All of the following roles are held by multi-sig addresses.*\n   1. Controlling the token supply - The supplyController address can mint and burn the token based on the actual movement of USD in and out of the reserve based on requests for the purchase, conversion and redemption of PAX.\n   2. Contract Owner - Can pause/unpause the contract and propose a new owner.\n   3. Asset Protection Role - As required by our regulators, we have introduced a role for asset protection to freeze or seize the assets of a criminal party when required to do so by law, including by court order or other legal process.\n   4. Upgradeability Proxy - To facilitate upgradeability on the immutable blockchain we follow a standard two-contract delegation pattern: a proxy contract represents the token, while all calls not involving upgrading the contract are delegated to an implementation contract. The proxy used here is AdminUpgradeabilityProxy from ZeppelinOS.\n   \n\n8.

    "description": "\n\n**Liquidity Mining Extension**\n\nGiven the liquidity mining program will end this week, this AIP will extend the current program by 4 weeks. This extension should give the community enough time to [debate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards/4852/15) any changes to the liquidity mining program without any interruption for Aave borrowers and lenders.\n\nThe same stkAAVE distribution will be used.\n\n**Liquidity Mining v1**\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced for Aave v2 on 4/26/21.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. stkAAVE was distributed over AAVE to further align users with the Aave Protocol and increase the amount of AAVE staked in the safety module.\n\n**Liquidity Mining Recap**\n\n-   Value Distributed: During the liquidity mining campaign, 198,000 stkAAVE will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Aave v2, using ~7% of the Ecosystem Reserve. This equates to $82MM in rewards (AAVE VWAP since LM program started).\n\n-   TVL: v2 TVL rose from $7.8 billion to a high of $14.4 billion in mid-May. Stablecoin liquidity accounts for more than 60% of total Aave v2 liquidity.\n\n-   V1 to V2 liquidity migration: v1 liquidity decreased from $2.5 billion to $372MM since the liquidity mining program started. 40% of Aave liquidity was deployed in v1 before the LM rewards started. Aave v1 liquidity now accounts for less than 3% of all liquidity on Aave. This allows the community to remain focused on v2 and upcoming money markets.\n\n-   Growth in dollar value supplied and borrowed: The USDC and DAI markets experienced the largest increase in dollar value supplied and borrowed. Note - many users on these markets have recursively levered their position to maximize yields. Recursive leverage accounts for ~32% of all deposits on v2. This compares to ~40% on Aave’s Polygon market.\n\n-   Reserve Growth: Aave reserves help provide the first layer of protection for borrowers and lenders. Since liquidity mining rewards launched, Aave’s v2 reserves have grown by [~$7MM](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c).\n",

This suggests the maximum cap of the interest rate curve is not able to reach a high enough value to effectively balance incentives between the borrow side and depositing side of the marketplace.\n\n![Deposit and Borrow APY on AAVE, 7/24/21](../assets/AIP-26/apys.png \"Deposit and Borrow APY on AAVE, 7/24/21\")\n\nWhile the AMPL spot market is currently in a relatively extreme condition, the AAVE borrowing market should be able to perform efficiently in all market scenarios.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe suggest the following parameters for AAVE's default [interest rate model](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate#interest-rate-model):\n\n- Optimal utilization = 75%\n- Slope1 = 2%\n- Slope2 = 10,000%\n\nThis leads to a piecewise linear curve with two parts and three defining points:\n\n- Borrow Interest(0) = 0% APY\n- Borrow Interest(75) = 2% APY\n- Borrow Interest(100) = 10002 % APY\n\n## Rationale\n\nA higher cap of the borrow interest rate will allow the marketplace to have a more sustainable equilibrium.\n\nSince this will result in overall higher fees coming into the system, in tandem we also suggest lowering the reserve factor from 20% to 10% to incentivize more depositors. This would be submitted as a separate AIP to decouple these two decisions.\n\nWe believe a nonlinear interest curve is healthiest long-term and could likely be used by many other assets as well, however this work can be discussed more in the future.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA deployment of the existing implementation of the Interest Strategy will be used, with the following parameters:\n\n    optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.75).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    baseVariableBorrowRate: new BigNumber(0).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.02).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n    variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(100).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x509859687725398587147Dd7A2c88d7316f92b02#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x509859687725398587147Dd7A2c88d7316f92b02#readContract)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe intention of this AIP is to test a cross-chain transaction workflow that would enable the Ethereum based smart contract for governance for the Aave Protocol (the \"Aave Ethereum Governance\") to control the deployment of the Aave Protocol on Polygon (the \"Aave Polygon market\"). The proposal is written as a transaction that would make updates to a **mock** Aave Polygon market. If approved, the transaction would trigger a cross-chain message, flowing from Aave's Ethereum Governance, to a new contract - the `PolygonBridgeExecutor`. The `PolygonBridgeExecutor` would store the proposed market updates for a delay window, and then allow for the updates to be executed on the **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\nThis proposal will allow testing the end-to-end crosschain transaction workflow for Polygon market governance using both the Ethereum and Polygon mainnet contracts in a way that cannot be replicated in another manner. This test will support the case in the future to transfer ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to Aave's Ethereum  governance.\n\n**In-Scope:**\nA test of the governance cross-chain bridge functionality on a **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\n**Out-of-Scope:**\nTransferring ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to the Aave Ethereum Governance \n\n## Abstract\n\nTest an implementation of a cross-chain governance workflow, allowing Aave's Ethereum Governance to execute a transaction updating a **mock** Aave market deployed on Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBefore anyone in the community or otherwise can make a proposal to transfer ownership of the Aave Polygon market to a cross-chain bridge workflow, it is necessary that any smart contracts be tested as thoroughly as possible. This AIP is a `real world` test using the Aave Ethereum Governance contract to test the cross-chain bridge contracts on a **mock** Aave Polygon Market. The main reasons for testing to this extent are:\n\n+ Cross-chain / bridge transactions are relatively new and complex\n+ The risk of this workflow being deployed and not operating correctly would have a HIGH impact\n\nThe transfer of ownership of the Aave Polygon Market to Aave's Ethereum Governance is **not** in-scope of this AIP, but understanding the motivation behind that desired change is important to understanding the motivation for this test.\n\nThe current owner of the Aave Polygon Market a multi-sig wallet due to the time needed to build a cross-chain governance platform, as well as ensuring security for a new deployment on a new network.\n\nGiven the overarching goal that any deployment of the Aave Protocol be owned by decentralized governance, transferring ownership of the Aave Polygon market contracts to Aave Ethereum Governance, is an important next step. Additionally, we have developed and deployed a cross-chain governance platform aimed at providing a broad solution for cross-chain governance. After appropriate testing (including this AIP) and auditing of the cross-chain bridge contract, anyone can create a future AIP to remove the multi-sig over the Aave Polygon market and transfer ownership of those smart contracts to Aave Ethereum Governance.\n\n## Specification\n\nA detailed specification of the crosschain-bridge contract and workflow is outlined in the repo here\n\nhttps://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges\n\nFor this test specifically, the test would flow from Aave Ethereum Governance, through a cross chain transaction to the `PolygonBridgeExecutor` contract. Then after a delay, the proposal would be executed on Polygon to make updates to the **mock** Aave Polygon market.\n\nThe general flow of this test will be\n\n1. Propose cross-chain test transactions (Aave governance-v2)\n2. Vote on cross-chain test transactions (Aave governance-v2)\n3. Queue test transactions\n4. Execute cross-chain test transactions\\\n4a. Execute transaction from Aave Governance (Aave governance-v2)\\\n4b. Bridge the test transactions to Polygon  (Polygon fxPortal and Polygon Inherent Bridge Functionality)\\\n4c. Receive bridged message on Polygon       (Polygon fxPortal and Polygon Inherent Bridge Functionality)\\\n4d. Queue transactions for execution in PolygonBridgeExecutor (Aave governance-crosschain-bridges)\\\n5. Wait for delay\n6. Execute queued transactions in the PolygonBridgeExecutor   (Aave governance-crosschain-bridges)\\\n6a. Turn off borrowing for the **mock** Dai reserve\\\n6b. Transfer POOL_ADMIN rights to a dummy address\\\n6c. Transfer ownership of the **mock** Aave market to a dummy address\\\n7. Confirm the expected updates have been made on **mock** Aave market\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis AIP will not make any actual changes in the current Aave Polygon market ecosystem or in any other deployment of the Aave Protocol. It is merely a test of a contract and workflow that, in the future, could enable the Aave Ethereum Governance to control the Aave Polygon Market.\n\nTesting the contracts that enable this cross-chain bridging as thoroughly as possible, including via this proposed test are rationale, despite their cost, given the critical role the cross-chain bridging will play if deployed and used for cross-chain governance.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nA full suit of tests with 100% coverage is included in the repo https://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges. The cross-chain workflow has also successfully been tested on the Goerli-Mumbai test networks.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA mock implementation of this proposed test can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/Aave/governance-crosschain-bridges/tree/feat/mainnet-test\n\nAfter setting up the repository: \n\n`npm run hardhat mock-mainnet-proposal-delegate`\nruns on Ethereum fork to makes sure everything is encoded correctly to be submitted for the proposal\n\n\n`npm run hardhat mock-Polygon-test-delegate`\nset a .env variable `Polygon_FORK = \"true\"` to run the test updating the Polygon market via the mainnet PolygonBridgeExecutor on a Polygon fork\n\nTwo helper contracts have been deployed to support this proposal. `PolygonMessageSender` has been deployed on Ethereum and `PolygonMarketUpdate` has been deployed on Polygon.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, calls the function sendMessage() on the `PolygonMessageSender` contract on Ethereum mainnet via a delegatecall. The sendMessage function encodes a delegatecall to the function executeUpate() on the contract `MarketUpdate` deployed on the Polygon network and then sends that encoded action to the `PolygonBridgeExecutor` on the Polygon network via Polygon's FxPortal. When that action is received in the PolygonBridgeExecutor, it will be queued. After a delay, that action can be executed, calling the function executeUpate() which will make three updates to a mock aave market deployed on Polygon:\n\n1. disable the mock dai reserve via the LendingPoolConfigurator contract\n2. Set the pool admin to the address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract\n3. Transfer ownership of the pool to the address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` via the LendingPoolAddressesProvider contract\n\n**Related Contracts:**\n\n*Ethereum PolygonMessageSender Contract*\nPolygonMessageSender: `0xf442C0faE2E9A157cD0202BD63bf9b932D3aa4C8` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xf442C0faE2E9A157cD0202BD63bf9b932D3aa4C8#code \\\n\n*Polygon FxPortal Bridge Contracts*\\\nFxRoot: `0xfe5e5D361b2ad62c541bAb87C45a0B9B018389a2` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5D361b2ad62c541bAb87C45a0B9B018389a2#code \\\nStateSender: `0x28e4F3a7f651294B9564800b2D01f35189A5bFbE` \\\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x28e4f3a7f651294b9564800b2d01f35189a5bfbe#code \\\nFxChild: `0x8397259c983751DAf40400790063935a11afa28a` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751DAf40400790063935a11afa28a#code\n\n*Polygon Bridge Executor Contracts*\\\nPolygonBridgeExecutor: `0x60966EA42764c7c538Af9763Bc11860eB2556E6B`\\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xd63b6b5e0f043e9779c784ee1c14ffcbffb98b70#code\n\n*Polygon Market Update*\\\nMarketUpdate: `0x5b494b94faf0bb63254dba26f17483bcf57f6d6a` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x5b494b94faf0bb63254dba26f17483bcf57f6d6a#code\n\n*Mock Polygon Market Contracts*\\\nLendingPoolAddressProviderAddress = `0x240de965908e06a76e1937310627b709b5045bd6`\\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0x240de965908e06a76e1937310627b709b5045bd6#code \\\nLendingPoolConfiguratorAddress (proxy)= `0xd63B6B5E0F043e9779C784Ee1c14fFcBffB98b70` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xd63b6b5e0f043e9779c784ee1c14ffcbffb98b70#writeContract#code \\\nLendingPoolConfiguratorAddress (implementation)= `0xADA061366575324945c7a097F829349acA6C9aB9` \\\nhttps://polygonscan.com/address/0xADA061366575324945c7a097F829349acA6C9aB9#code\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFrax is the first algorithmic-stablecoin protocol, backed through on-chain collateral and algorithmically. Frax has two tokens, the FRAX stablecoin pegged at $1 and the FXS governance + seigniorage token, and aims to be a decentralized crypto-native unit of account with the upcoming Frax Price Index (FPI). FRAX has stayed at $1 for its entire existence, being the only non-traditional stablecoin to keep its peg perfectly in 8 months of release.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe FRAX stablecoin is partially backed with on-chain collateral and partially backed algorithmically, according to a collateral ratio (CR) parameter that the system adjusts according to market conditions. In Frax v2, the protocol is able to mint FRAX into lending markets using [Algorithmic Market Operations](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) (AMOs), smart contracts which have the ability to print FRAX up to certain thresholds adjustable by governance.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the value of Aave's TVL increases, borrow liquidity for stablecoins against volatile assets lent to Aave is one of the key benefits that is offered to lenders of the protocol. The flow of newly minted stablecoins to their decentralized lending market destination such as Aave is not always direct, and may face market inefficiencies through layers of actors.\n\nBy [deploying an AMO for Aave](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/frax-lending), the Frax protocol is able to mint FRAX to be borrowed by lenders of Aave, and thus offer an active and competitive alternative to other stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, and DAI. By allowing for responsive stablecoin liquidity, we aim to benefit lenders and the Aave ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, With no collateral factor, there is 0 risk for Aave's money market in terms of the FRAX peg. Furthermore, if the FRAX peg broke and fell below $1, Aave borrowers would have less debt in dollar terms.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\n\t- Co-founder of Frax.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\n\t- FRAX is the world's first fractionally-algorithmic stablecoin, stabilized with parts on-chain collateral and parts algorithmically.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\n\t- Frax's AMOs are able to mint FRAX into the Aave lending market, allowing for highly competitive stablecoin borrowing rates for lenders.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n\t- FRAX launched at the end of 2020 and currently has over $300M in circulating FRAX. FRAX has never once broken the peg of $1, even through sharp market downturns such as in March 2021. Frax's governance token FXS has maintained governance functionality since inception through a fork of Compound's GovernorAlpha.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n\t- FRAX is currently used as a stablecoin in decentralized exchanges and other lending markets such as Rari's Fuse Protocol, where it is currently the most-borrowed and most-supplied stablecoin in several pools through Frax's AMOs.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\n\t- There is no emission schedule; FRAX is mintable by anyone anytime by depositing corresponding amounts of collateral and FXS into the system's contracts.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\n\t- The protocol is highly modular in terms of system parameters such as oracle addresses and AMO additions. The core contracts such as the token contract itself are non-proxy deployed and permissioned through governance's 2-day timelock, with a backup multisig admin address managed by the core Frax team.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n    - Market Cap: $307M\n    - 24h Volume: $15M\n    - Volatility: Extremely Low\n    - Maturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n\t- 13K followers on Twitter, 6.2K members on Telegram, Github is updated frequently.\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\n    - Date of Deployment: December 20th, 2020\n    - Number of Transactions: 110,000+\n    - Number of Holders: 1,600+\n\n## Rationale\n\nFrax's design rationale came as a synthesis of a crypto-native stablecoin with capital efficiency, allowing it to perform algorithmic market operations while managed by on on-chain DAO. As Frax expands, it can compound on its own network effects by being a highly liquid routing asset on DEXes and a default borrowing option for many lending market pools. To keep decentralization at the forefront, the USDC collateral is spread out through other lending markets and DEXes, and is planned to be rotated to ETH and ETH-equivalent collateral as the protocol matures. Furthermore, the Frax Price Index (FPI) allows for a shift away from the USD unit-of-account into the first major stable crypto-native unit-of-account.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FRAX price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FRAX/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFRAX will only be used for depositing and lending and not as collateral, with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) value of 0%. The other parameters are as such:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFRAX address: 0x6efD37b3015AeA0E19418f98661488A4D2D3C377\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFRAX address: 0x08FFf652bEF777634585707B17627c9274E3dB11\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFRAX address: 0x7E3Ddfceef69bEC3A38Fc9AE8D7A8c46D7788C6b\n- Strategy Implementation for FRAX address: 0xb0a73aC3B10980A598685d4631c83f5348F5D32c\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n\n[Trail of Bits Audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/FraxFinance.pdf)\n\n[CertiK Audit](https://www.certik.org/projects/fraxfinance)\n\n**Note that the risk assessment was performed in May 2021, when FRAX's market cap was $110M**\n\n**FRAX Smart Contract Risk**: **C**\n\nFrax has been live on the Ethereum mainnet for over 8 months.\n\n**FRAX Counterparty Risk**: **C+**\n\nCurrently the Frax protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol is meant to be governance minimized with a gradual transition to DAO + comptrollers.\n\n**FRAX Market Risk**: **B**\n\nThe current FRAX market cap is over $307,000,000 USD. The average 24H trading volume in the past month has been over $14,000,000 USD.

    "description": "\n## **AAVE AIP 32**\n\n**Liquidity Mining V1**\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced for Aave v2 on 4/26/21.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day were allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. stkAAVE was distributed over AAVE to further align users with the Aave Protocol and increase the amount of AAVE staked in the safety module.\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v1-program.png)\n\nLiquidity Mining Recap (as of 7/15/21)\n\n-   Value Distributed: During the liquidity mining campaign, 198,000 stkAAVE will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Aave v2, using ~7% of the Ecosystem Reserve. This equates to $82MM in rewards (AAVE VWAP since LM program started).\n\n-   TVL: v2 TVL rose from $7.8 billion to a high of $14.4 billion in mid-May. Stablecoin liquidity accounts for more than 60% of total Aave v2 liquidity.\n\n-   V1 to V2 liquidity migration: v1 liquidity decreased from $2.5 billion to $372MM since the liquidity mining program started. 40% of Aave liquidity was deployed in v1 before the LM rewards started. Aave v1 liquidity now accounts for less than 3% of all liquidity on Aave. This allows the community to remain focused on v2 and upcoming money markets.\n\n-   Growth in dollar value supplied and borrowed: The USDC and DAI markets experienced the largest increase in dollar value supplied and borrowed. Note - many users on these markets have recursively levered their position to maximize yields. Recursive leverage accounts for ~32% of all deposits on v2. This compares to ~40% on Aave’s Polygon market.\n\n-   Reserve Growth: Since liquidity mining rewards launched, Aave’s v2 reserves have grown by [~$7MM](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c).\n\n\nChange in v2 markets from 4/26/21 to 7/15/21\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v1-recap.png)\n\n**Liquidity Mining V2**\n\nAave's liquidity mining program is ending in the next few days.\n\nWe have seen several adjustments discussed in the forums including adding/removing new assets, allocating rewards based on health factors, additional vesting for stkAAVE rewards, and discouraging recursive borrowing. However, after discussing with several Aave community members and developers, these changes would require a heavy technical lift and potentially layer on a centralized distribution plan.\n\nWe are open to these changes in the future but to avoid a disruption to the liquidity mining program, we propose the following program for the next 3 months:\n\nThis proposal [passed on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmeHAwW7XwUD3vqYLMRPF8MJiXkj2nnbRg1ae7mZ1SNQdm) with 91.7k AAVE voting in favor.\n\n![AAVE](../assets/AIP-32/v2-program.png)\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDecrease in Daily stkAAVE Distributed\n\nThis program would decrease the liquidity mining distribution by 9%, saving $7.1MM for the Aave Ecosystem Reserve during the 3 month program.\n\nNew Assets\n\nThe goal of this program is to create a more inclusive liquidity mining program with the option to further refine the distribution once live.\n\nStablecoins remain the highest value asset for Aave v2. This program distributes 40% of the stkAAVE distribution to the USDC market given the USDC market size and utilization. The USDT distribution has been lowered and allocated to other stablecoin markets including DAI, RAI, PAX, TUSD, and sUSD. The DAI allocation has been increased to account for higher utilization and encourage more deposits.\n\nWe believe incentivizing several centralized and decentralized stablecoin markets will help build a more robust stablecoin ecosystem in Aave v2. As new stablecoins are onboarded to Aave, the Aave community can choose to include them in the distribution. The allocations across new markets will likely need fine tuning as we analyze borrow/lend activity.\n\nWBTC and ETH allocations have been decreased and re-distributed to DeFi tokens listed on Aave.\n\nSeveral tokens including LINK, YFI, xSUSHI, UNI, MKR, and BAL have also been included. The rewards for all of these markets are weighted 100% to lenders.\n\nSimilar to the first version of Aave’s liquidity mining program, we believe the distribution parameters will need to be further refined once borrow/lend activity is available.\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, Fei Protocol will be committing 25m FEI to bootstrap the market and 4M TRIBE in incentives for borrowing for at least the first 6 months.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in interest rate markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9.

The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableOne\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0xAcF35Af93a65904C50ED93dfb010bAAdEBb4ccF0\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0x1B669D5034143E272b5Ff548f2878735A2F3505A\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0x1DdcF68f4C2600CBE534212765F964342a2faf02\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0xF0bA2a8c12A2354c075b363765EAe825619bd490\n\nAdditionally the Fei Smart Contracts team contributed an ERC-20 compatibile incentives controller contract to the Aave codebase so other teams can add rewards in their native token: https://github.com/aave/incentives-proposal/pull/5 \n\n- TRIBE Incentives Controller Implementation: 0xff865335401f12b88fa3ff5a3a51685a7f224191\n- and proxy: 0xDee5c1662bBfF8f80f7c572D8091BF251b3B0dAB\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "basename": "AIP-4",
    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAave V2 governance is inspired by delegation-based governance models already on the market, while introducing 3 key innovations and a new layer of resilience:\n\nThe introduction of a new concept in DeFi governance - the **segregation between voting and proposition power** to increase control and ownership of voting rights for AAVE holders.\nAAVE holders will have the choice between delegating proposal creation power to specialized actors while holding their voting rights; or even delegating them to another entity.\n\n**Voting strategies** - The AAVE token exists and is used in the Aave ecosystem in a variety of ways. Through different voting strategies, AAVE in different forms can be used to vote and create proposals. In the initial implementation both AAVE and stkAAVE holders will have voting and proposal creation rights. Voting strategies can be upgraded at any time through a governance proposal to include other forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)\n\n**Multiple executor entities** - Different components of the ecosystem might have different needs for consensus and security. For example, changing the AAVE token logic itself might have a large impact on the ecosystem and is something that requires higher consensus than adjusting a risk management parameter. The Aave governance V2 splits the control of different entities within the Aave ecosystem between different executors with different execution delays (timelocks) and different consensus parameters. At the beginning there will be two different executors:\n\n**a.** Executor 1 (short timelock) will control the whole Aave Protocol v1, the token distributor used in v1, the contract collecting the v1 fees, the AAVE Reserve Ecosystem and any change in this timelock itself. Once the break-in period for Aave V2 is completed, this timelock will also control the current Aave V2 market and all the future markets instantiated by the Aave Genesis Team.\n\n- admin : Aave Governance v2\n- delay : 1 day\n- grace period : 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 0.5%\n- voting duration: 3 days\n- vote differential: 0.5%\n- Approval quorum: 2%\n\n**b.** Executor 2 (long timelock) will control the upgradeability of the AAVE token, stkAAVE, any change in v2 governance parameters and any change in the parameters of this timelock itself.\n\n- admin: Aave Governance v2\n- delay: 7 days\n- grace period: 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 2%\n- voting duration: 10 days\n- vote differential: 15%\n- Approval quorum: 20%\n\nThe Guardian - As long as a large majority of AAVE tokens are in a centralised exchange, it’s impossible to prevent a STEEM-like governance attack where a centralised entity would use its users’ assets to take over a decentralised protocol through governance. As a security measure to avoid such a scenario, a temporary 5/10 multisig is given a power of veto to cancel proposals in case malicious code is introduced through an AIP. Those entities have been chosen within the AAVE community to be globally distributed, and they cover safety skill sets through governance, code, and economic analysis. Guardians can be changed later through election.\nThe current multisig signers are : James Vaugh (Fire Eyes/Metacartel), Anthony Sassano (SET protocol/ETHhub/Daily Gwei), Mariano Conti (ex MakerDAO head of smart contracts), Tarun Chitra (Gauntlet), DeFiSaver, Zerion, Parafi Capital, Framework Venture, Arthur0x and the Aave Genesis Team\nSome of the expected short-term outcomes of this implementation are new actors creating proposals for token additions, risk parameter upgrades or new liquidity market creation.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Implementation of the Aave Governance v2 smart contract\n- Implementation of voting delegation and proposal power delegation\n- Implementation of voting strategies with the inclusion of AAVE and StkAAVE\n- Addition of voting and proposition power delegations on AAVE and SktAAVE\n- Implementation of Executor entities\n- Implementation of the Guardian\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nCreating a Governance V1 Proposal vote with the proposal executor at https://etherscan.io/address/0xd194b24913806fc885f1fecd3e776f8449e5e24a#code\n\nIf the proposal passes:\n\na.

Curve offers an optimised model for stablecoin trading and revenue sharing incentives with fees from the >$10B in cumulative trading volume\n\n## CRV Smart Contract Risk: B-\nCRV token was introduced to Curve in August 2020 through liquidity mining. The code has 3 audits from ToB, Quantstamp and MixBytes. It is central in the DAO operations enabling stakers to vote and boost their yields with the locking of CRV. This model has generated half a billion transactions in half a year, with around 15,000 holders\n\n## CRV Counterparty Risk: B\nThe Curve DAO operates as a fully decentralised organisation with community proposals and votes. The ecosystem is funded by fees of the Curve Exchange generated by the $40m of daily volume\n\n## CRV Market Risk: C\nCurve is one of the leading DeFi projects. The token is available on top exchanges with nearly $100m market capitalisation and nearly as much average daily volume though a large share of CRV’s supply is locked. CRV experienced volatility in the last month with the rest of the market having yet to recover\nCRV’s risk profile is close to YFI’s leading to the same model parameters\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n- LTV 40%\n- Liquidation Threshold 55%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 20%\n\n## Variable Interest Rate Model\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/chSyDxc.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\nCRV fits the profile of a collateral asset, with the need for a conservative borrow rate model with a low optimal utilisation to protect collateral liquidity\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n### Code \nThe code is part of the standard Aave protocol deployment (the AToken, Debt tokens and interest rate strategy) therefore no audits are needed. The code can be found here https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/master/contracts/protocol/tokenization\n\n### Test Cases \nBeing a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support CRV.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe CRV token doesn’t have any specific behavior (eg. rebasing, balance increasing) and doesn’t offer meta governance functionalities since it requires locking to participate in the governance. Therefore, the standard AToken contract and corresponding debt tokens, already used for the majority of assets listed in Aave, can be also used for CRV. No auditing of the code is required.\n\n",

    "description": "\n## Simple Summary\nThe Gemini dollar is a cryptographic token that is issued by Gemini, strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.\n\n\n## Abstract\nAdd GUSD to the AAVE V2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nGUSD is an additional fiat on-ramp into the DeFi ecosystem that will help diversify fiat sources inside of AAVE markets.\n\n## Specification\nGUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange. I have personally tested this out and was impressed with the results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being. GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.\n\n## Rationale\nBenefits for Aave:\n\nDiversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Aave security module stakers.\nNew DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.\nWhile Coinbase have played nice so far, it’s dominance in regulated crypto liquidity and USDC on/off ramp has huge influence over the space. I see Gemini and GUSD as a viable competitor. From an industrial economics standpoint, Aave and other Defi protocols like Maker may benefit from breaking down monopolies of their key counter-parties.\n\n## Risk Analysis\n\nThe Risk Team has applied Aave’s Risk Framework to GUSD leading to an overall risk rating of B-\n\nGUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company. It has been created for practical use in innovative applications, among which to facilitate Gemini’s institutional solutions and exchange operations.\n\nGUSD Smart contract Risk: C+\n\nGUSD was launched in September 2018 – at the same time then USDC – yet it has only experienced 120k blockchain transactions.\n\nThe GUSD smart contract only supports 2 decimals meaning that interest accrual can only occur for more than 1 cent.\n\nUSDC Counterparty Risk: C+ cannot use as collateral (centralisation D-)\n\nAs it is backed by real US dollars, GUSD is centralised. Moreover it has few holders with most of the transactions off-chain on the centralised Gemini environment.\n\nAn independent accountant’s audit report is published at the end of each month on the website. GUSD is regulated bringing trust to the token. Still, the infrastructure is based on the Ethereum blockchain where regulators have little power.\n\nGUSD Market Risk: B -\n\nGUSD has a small market capitalisation at less than 20m with a small trading volume. The price has diverged from 1 a few times in the last 3 months with up to 3% price variation.\nGiven the reduced market capitalization and the possibility of market price manipulation, the oracle will fix the price of GUSD to $1. This does not bring additional risk because the asset cannot be used as collateral and even if the market price swings considerably, the asset is still redeemable 1:1 for USD. The risk team will reevaluate the asset periodically to validate the viability of an actual market based oracle as the GUSD supply grows.  \n\nRisk Parameters ~ BUSD sUSD\nNot a collateral\nReserve Factor 10%\n\nVariable Interest Rate Model ~ BUSD sUSD\nUOptimal 80%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 4%\n\nR_s2 100%\n\n## References\n\n- *Whitepaper*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf\n- *Website*: https://gemini.com/dollar\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Gemini\n- *Source Code*: https://github.com/gemini/dollar\n- *GUSD token contract*: https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd\n- *Accountant’s reports at bottom of page*: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports\n- *Trail of bits contract audit*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nOn the 25th of September 2020, with the results of AIP-1, the Aave protocol kickstarted its initial phase of Aavenomics and Safety Incentives with a scheduled distribution of 400 AAVE per day to Safety module stakers.\n\nWith the implementation of the Aave Protocol V2 and the soft deadline of first-quarter reached, this proposal will allow an upgrade of the reserve emission model for the Safety module.\n\nThis AIP will increase the responsibility of AAVE stakers for their service of protecting the Aave protocol by the formal activation of the slashing.\n\nThe slashing officially enforces the currently implicit responsibility and risk of the participation in the stakings modules of Aave. In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.\n\nIn this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day\n- Slashing %: The maximum slashing amount is set to 30%\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe payload to be executed is available at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab8ba929e4cc780cb82be34eea29a9ea7a58049#code\n\nThe payload will upgrade the Aave reserve contract to a new implementation\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa335e2443b59d11337e9005c9af5bc31f8000714#code\n\nAnd introduce a reserve controller, with the rights of approving transfers/transferring assets out of the Aave Reserve, under control of the Aave governance short executor\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93#code\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nBAL is the governance token of [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore), a programmable liquidity and asset managment protocol with over [$800M in TVL](https://defipulse.com/balancer) according to DeFi Pulse.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd [BAL](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d) to the AAVE V2 market.\n\nBalancer is a DEX that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens, custom allocations and fees. Smart pools in Balancer can be used for programmable liquidity. \n\nTraders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. \n\nBAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals. BAL also receives preferential treatment in the Balancer exchange liquidity mining program.\n\nBalancer is responsible for the creation of [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/), and currently leading a number of [governance intiatives](https://snapshot.page/#/balancer/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) to reward active contributions to the protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Balancer gears up for the launch of Balancer V2, composability becomes key for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, BAL has a market cap of $230M.\n\nApart from the BAL liquidity on Balancer, BAL is also listed on FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Gemini and other centralized exchanges.\n\nAdding BAL to Aave will be the first major lending/borrowing market for the asset, and one that sets precedent for future exploration of Balancer Pool Token (BPT) markets similar to [Aave V1 Uniswap Markets](https://medium.com/aave/the-uniswap-market-is-live-on-aave-protocol-12b5a4cc5e2).\n\nAave leverages Balancer for it's [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), meaning this partnership further cements the relationship between the two protocols.\n\n*\"The advantage of using Balancer against other AMM solutions is clear when we factor in the possibility of dynamically adjusting the weighting towards AAVE. This allows for the creation of a market and the provision of liquidity whilst maintaining exposure to AAVE. Holding AAVE/ETH liquidity with uneven weights is very close to simply holding AAVE, with the benefits of earning trading fees on top of it.\"*\n\n\n## Benefits for Aave\nBalancer has an increasingly active community which would bring more users and liquidity to Aave.\n\nBAL earns native rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 80%+ APY with limited impermanent loss. This has generated strong borrowing demand for BAL on CREAM, with deposit rates often above 10%.\n\nWith deposit rates so high, it becomes super cost effective for people to borrow funds with BAL as collateral, often times with an effective negative borrowing rate!\n\n## Specification\nBAL will continue to see increased governance activity in the coming months.\n\nAdding BAL to the Aave V2 markets will provide strong borrowing demand, generating protocol fees and allowing for further governance participation.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBalancer and Aave are natural partners. Aave leverages Balancer for it's Safety Module and it only seems natural that BAL should be listed on Aave given the depth of the AAVE liquidity Balancer today.\n\nThis proposal opens design space for future lending use-cases, both on Balancer's end and on Aave's for more niche specific liqudity pool markets.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nWhitepaper - https://balancer.finance/whitepaper 1  \nWebsite - https://balancer.finance 1  \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs  \nBlog - https://balancer.finance/blog-feed  \nDocumentation - https://docs.balancer.finance  \nSource Code - https://github.com/balancer-labs 2  \nBAL Token Contract - https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#code 1  \n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Trail of Bits, Conesnsys Dilligence and Open Zeppelin.](https://docs.balancer.finance/core-concepts/security/audits)  \n\n[AAVE Community x BAL Risk Assesment](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-bal/1787/6?u=coopahtroopa)  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lrXmHFD.png)  \n\n**BAL Smart contract Risk: B-**\n\nSince it's launch in June BAL has reached half a million transactions driven by liquidity mining distribution program which may lead to inflation.

The contract of the ABPT can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84).\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution for ABPT stakers at the rate of 550 AAVE/day. The contract of the stkABPT can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47).\n\nThe Safety Module is designed as an additional line of defense for Aave protocol liquidity providers and Both highliquidity and Safety module reserve can mitigate the possibility of bad debt in the occurence of a shortfall event.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Start of the Safety Incentives for ABPT stakers with initial SI rewards of 550 AAVE/day.\n\n## Safety Incentives Schedule\n\nIf the community accepts the current AIP, the Safety Incentives will add 550 AAVE/day to the ABPT tokens Stakers.\n\nFor a total of 1100 AAVE/day Safety Incentives allocation.\n\nThe Safety Incentive's allocation quarterly date should be voted on before the end of the 3 months (90 days) distribution schedule. In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Implementations details\n\nThe implementation of the AIP consist in three actions: \n- Transfer proxy ownerships of [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84) and [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to the Long Timelocked Governance Executor.\n- Configure [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to reward stakers for 550 AAVE per day.\n- Approve 550 AAVE per day for 3 months allowance from Reserve for [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) rewards.\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the execution process :\n\n- [AIP9 Proposal Payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd08E12367A7D68CAA8ff080D3A56b2dc6650709b#contracts)\n- [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84)\n- [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47)\n- [Aave Reserve Controller](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nOptimizing ETH rates on Aave v2 ethereum mainnet to meet the borrowing demands generated from the inclusion of stETH collateral.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the inclusion of new collateral type stETH the borrowing of ETH has increased to an all time high (4-6x more utilization) it is now critical to adjust rates to continue growth under current conditions.\n\nCurrently, stETH earns ~3.9% APR from staking rewards, while still being used as collateral in Aave, which allows users to go leverage on stETH while borrowing ETH. This is only sensible to do when ETH borrow rates are lower than stETH rewards. With the current interest modals the utilization has reached up to 19% (an all time high) and can grow further to about 24%. With the above updates it will allow utilization to go up to 70%. Yeilding good returns to users and a 3-4x increase in ETH revenue for the Aave protocol.\n\nFollow the forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed updated to ETH rates:\n\n- OPTIMAL_UTILIZATION_RATE = **70** (previously: 65)\n- EXCESS_UTILIZATION_RATE = **30** (previously: 35)\n- baseVariableBorrowRate = **0** (previously: 0)\n- variableRateSlope1 = **3** (previously: 8)\n- variableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n- stableRateSlope1 = **4** (previously: 10)\n- stableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent stETH rewards are 4%. Staking rewards on ETH via Lido are still relatively high and stETH still has the capacity to accept another $4.5B of ETH. This increase in stETH supply would only reduce the rewards by 0.3%, meaning there is at least 1.5M ETH (~$4-5B USD) that could get staked. For Aave, it represents $4-5B in borrowings of ETH (more significant than any borrowing market that currently exists across any token)\n\n**Projected rates at current a 3% borrowing rate:**\n\n- Utilization: 24.5% [very low utilization leading to less revenue generation]\n- Borrowing rate: 3.02%\n- Supplying rate: 0.66% [low incentives for new lenders to come in]\n\n**Projected rates at 3% borrow rate and 70% utilization:**\n\n- Utilization: 70% [good revenue for governance]\n- Borrow rate: 3%\n- Supplying rate: 1.9% [decent for new lenders to come in or to get a discount for stable coin borrowing against ETH]\n\nSee Governance Post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Implementation\n\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEc368D82cb2ad9fc5EfAF823B115A622b52bcD5F#code) is the new rate strategy.\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49e4db0a4d63c73bae75747ee12ab63bbdda3207#code) is the execution payload.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAdd Gelato’s G-UNI DAI/USDC and G-UNI USDC/USDT pools as collateral to Aave’s AMM market with these parameters:\n\nCollateral: **yes**\nLTV: **60%**\nLiquidation Threshold: **70%**\nLiquidation Bonus: **15%**\nReserve Factor: **10%**\n\n## Abstract\n\nG-UNI is an ERC20 wrapper around Uniswap v3 LP NFTs which can be used to make liquidity provision on Uniswap v3 fungible and its fee reinvestment process automated. It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens. \n\nTwo G-UNI Pools have been deployed with Uniswap V3 Positions in highly concentrated ranges (centered around 1:1) on the 0.01% fee tier of both DAI/USDC and USDC/USDT markets. Add liquidity to these pools and earn auto compounded LP fees on these high volume uniswap v3 stablecoin pairs, just by holding the G-UNI LP Token. Because of the fungible nature of these G-UNI tokens which represent proportions of a shared Uniswap V3 position, they are a simple solution for lending and borrowing markets to onboard Uniswap V3 LP as a collateral type.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBased on several discussions with Aave stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI / USDC and USDC / USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Aave users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3. Moreover, this would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nGelato is the development team behind G-UNI\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nThe token is a wrapper around stablecoin pairs on Uniswap v3, it only uses Gelato’s network of keepers to automate fee compounding\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nG-UNI would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nG-UNI was deployed to Mainnet in June 2021 and since then projects such as Instadapp, MakerDAO, Float and Rari have integrated it. We worked a lot to understand the inner mechanism of Uniswap v3 and did 2 external audits to ensure the smart contracts we are using are secure.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAs Collateral in MakerDAO or for Liquidity mining incentives in projects such as Float or Fei for example.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nNo emission\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll pools will be immutable, as the upgradability key will or already has been burned.\n\n8.

    "description": "\n​\n## Simple Summary\n​\nTerraUSD (UST) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin. UST’s market capitalization has grown to almost $8.5B since its inception in October 2020. UST is designed such that each UST can be redeemed for $1 of LUNA and vice versa. This mechanism has kept the price close to the peg. \n \nAdding UST to Aave should drive additional stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to the protocol. This proposal recommends a 0% collateral factor for UST.\n​\n## Abstract\n​\nThe version of UST added will be USTw (Wormhole UST). The Terra ecosystem is migrating from the centralized Shuttle Bridge to the decentralized Wormhole V2 bridge.\n​\nThe UST peg is maintained through an open market arbitrage system facilitated by Terra’s market module. An explanation of the contraction system is outlined below:\n​\nIf 1 UST is trading at .99 USD, users can buy 1 UST for .99 USD. Users then utilize Terra Station’s market swap function to trade 1 UST for 1 USD of Luna. The swap burns 1 UST and mints 1 USD of Luna. Users profit .01 UST from the swap. This arbitrage continues, and UST is burned to mint Luna until the price of UST rises back to 1 USD.\n​\nThe reverse works if 1 UST is trading above 1.00 USD. Through this system, UST has been able to maintain its peg within a relatively tight range.\n​\n​\n## Motivation\n​\nUST is supported by major Ethereum and Terra dApps including Curve, Uniswap, Sushi, Mirror, and Anchor. We believe there will be strong demand to borrow and lend UST given its stability and liquidity profile. UST will likely drive additional stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to AAVE.\n​\nFinally, Terra has begun its migration from its centrally held bridge to Wormhole. This move should decrease the risks associated with UST while improving its network effects as it reaches more chains in the future.\n​\n## Specification\n​\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n​\nParaFi Capital is an active AAVE governance participant, submitting AIPs to list stable assets including FEI, and modifying liquidity mining incentives. ParaFi is also a user of AAVE and UST.\n​\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n​\nUST is part of the Terra ecosystem, started by the Terra Form Labs team. UST has been live since October 2020 and has become the largest decentralized stablecoin. The number of unique holders of UST has grown substantially over the past few months, and we expect that figure to grow as UST launches on more chains.\n​\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n​\nUST’s on-chain and off-chain liquidity profile have improved significantly this year. Additionally, UST’s stability has improved, especially during market dislocations. We believe UST will drive more stablecoin liquidity and borrow demand to Aave. \n​\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n​\nTerra is a blockchain protocol and stablecoin ecosystem centered around fiat-pegged, seigniorage style stablecoins. Terra was developed by Terra Form Labs. The Terra ecosystem supports dozens of DeFi and metaverse applications. \n \nThe wormhole Terra contracts have been developed by Certus One (part of Jump Crypto) and audited by Kudelski. The wormhole v2 contracts are in active development.\n​\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n​\nUST can be used in dozens of applications across Terra, Ethereum, and Solana.\n​\n6. Emission schedule\n​\nThere is no emission schedule. The supply of UST is expanded or contracted to maintain the $1 peg.\n​\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n​\nAs mentioned above, we believe the main concern with adding UST is its centralized bridge solution - this changes with Wormhole.\n \nThe Wormhole Network underpins the bridge with a validator set that observes the chains it’s connected on. The Network is governed by 19 guardians that watch connected chains and sign message observations. Users deposit funds onto the token bridge from where their tokens are originating (e.g. UST on Terra) and the action is deconstructed into a message which is sent to the Wormhole Network who validates it and produces a signed message. The signed message is sent to the output token bridge (e.g. USTw on Ethereum) which verifies it and sends the user the wrapped bridge tokens.\n​\nGiven the track record of UST, we believe the addition of UST would pose low risk to the Aave ecosystem.\n​\n6.

This limits the risk for Aave and its users in other markets. As the wormhole contracts continue to be used and UST gains further adoption, the collateral factor can be increased. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is similar to other stablecoins per: https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n​\n## Implementation\n​\nThe UST price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [UST/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses). The Chainlink UST/ETH Price Feed Proxy contract address is 0xa20623070413d42a5C01Db2c8111640DD7A5A03a. \n​\nUST will only be used for depositing, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n​\n​\n - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n - Borrowing Enabled: true\n - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n - Reserve Decimals: 6\n - Reserve Factor: 2000\n​\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n​\n- Interest bearing aUST: 0x6C35faC782Be2Db776cdF777196a47916806892b\n- Variable Debt variableDebtUST: 0xd8aBEdc9CE320752e77C4A8706E64212EdE834B9\n- Stable Debt stableDebtUST: 0x107ed1832647436a0D39F09e65f4aA920242C0BB\n- Strategy Implementation for UST: 0x0dEDCaE8Eb22A2EFB597aBde1834173C47Cff186\n- Incentive Controller: 0x036cA61C1977c6EA52222Db81F725fDBd70eFBd7\n\n\nThe Incentive Controller was added in anticipation of LUNA incentives to UST borrowers/lenders being proposed by the community and thus for future engineering simplicity.\n​\n## References\n​\nWebsite - https://terra.money\n​\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/terra_money and https://twitter.com/wormholecrypto\n​\nDocs - https://docs.terra.money/ and https://docs.wormholenetwork.com/wormhole/\n​\nGithub - https://github.com/terra-money and https://github.com/certusone/wormhole\n​\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0xa693B19d2931d498c5B318dF961919BB4aee87a5\n​\n## Copyright\n​\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

The interest of SEBA’s clients and prospects for crypto earning products has grown substantially overtime. The launch of Aave Arc with its permissioned layer represents a great opportunity for them to access DeFi yields while remaining compliant with their regulatory obligations. At SEBA, we believe that this will directly benefit the Aave community with institutional liquidities accelerating growth in TVL and in protocol revenues.\n\nThe Aave Governance reviews and approves Whitelisters that will conduct the requisite level of due diligence on Aave Arc participants. As a Swiss digital asset bank, we believe that SEBA is ideally positioned to provide those investors with the flexible and fully regulated platform that they need to bridge new liquidities in Aave Arc. We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-adding-seba-bank-as-a-whitelister-to-aave-arc/6661) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith an increasing demand from institutional investors for accessing new opportunities in the DeFi space, SEBA has positioned DeFi at the heart of its strategy by developing a suite of products and services in relation with decentralized finance. Recently, SEBA has integrated several DeFi tokens into its proprietary institutional-grade cold storage custody solution, including AAVE.\n\nBeyond innovation and transparency brought by permissionless DeFi, SEBA is a strong believer that Aave Arc represents a thoughtful response to a growing institutional demand, which is subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations in various jurisdictions. In line with that vision and with innovation at the center of its values, SEBA believes it fulfills the key attributes to perform the role of Whitelister in Aave Arc.\n\n## Specification\n\n[Reference](https://github.com/aave/aip/blob/9da687033ae0536377b822c9196dd783be0e3e65/content/aips/4C7076AA6CC7-AIP-FIREBLOCKS-WHITELISTER-ON-AAVE-ARC.md#specification) to standard.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave community voted on the [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmNfumVDA2GkmyA3xWC12HhDFGBUybSAHUpvygqkMnV34V) with Yes 324K AAVE (100%) and No 3.3 AAVE (0%).\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal executes a single call to the [PermissionManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract to add [SEBA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC5eeEd1a811b77d64A37d94CF0363bA716375FDd) as PermissionAdmin in Aave ARC market:\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0xC5eeEd1a811b77d64A37d94CF0363bA716375FDd]);`\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Aave DAO is to perform a token swap with Balancer DAO. The Aave DAO is to acquire 200,000 BAL tokens for 16907.28 AAVE tokens based on a 90 day moving average exchange rate of 1 AAVE for 11.8292250604 BAL tokens. \n\nUpon completion of the transaction the BAL tokens will be received into the mainnet Reserve Factor (RF).\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP only performs the very first step in creating a veBAL holding for the Aave DAO. This AIP performs only the token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens.\n\nThis is the initial transaction that will then allow for the 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The B-80BAL-20WETH Liquidity Provider position will then be locked up for 1 year. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave and Balancer have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [1](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/).\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [2](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe). There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [3](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances). Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [4](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances). Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [5](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555).\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n* The full test of the Proposal Payload can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/aave-balancer-swap\n* The full test of the Swap contract can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/bal-aave-token-swap\n\n## Implementation\n\nCode Implementation of the OTC swap contract and AAVE proposal payload for AAVE Governance : https://github.com/llama-community/aave-balancer-swap\n\nThe full implementation consists of 4 steps:\n1. Deploy the Swap contract (`OtcEscrowApprovals`). The Swap contract contains a `swap()` function that trustlessly executes a token swap between the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve + AAVE Mainnet Reserve Factor and Balancer treasury for the pre-determined and pre-approved token amounts.\n2. Balancer treasury approves the Swap contract to transfer the 200,000 BAL tokens on its behalf.\n3. Deploy the Proposal Payload contract (`ProposalPayload`). \n4. The Proposal Payload contract contains an `execute()` function that:\n* Approves the Swap contract contract through the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve Controller to transfer 16907.28 AAVE from the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n* Calls the `swap()` function on the Swap contract to execute the swap. \n\nSteps 1, 2 and 3 are intended to be pre-requisites to the actual implementation of this proposal which is Step 4.\n\n**Deployed Contracts**\n* OtcEscrowApprovals = [0x5AE986d7ca23fc3519daaa589E1d38d19BA42a47](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ae986d7ca23fc3519daaa589e1d38d19ba42a47)\n* ProposalPayload = [0xc730008C64783a283988b0fA3b5eE6b6F997922A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc730008c64783a283988b0fa3b5ee6b6f997922a)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
